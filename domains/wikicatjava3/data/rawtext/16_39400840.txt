google hangouts google hangouts is a communication platform developed by google which includes instant messaging video chat sms and voip features it replaces three messaging products that google had implemented concurrently within its services including google talk google messenger formerly huddle and hangouts a video chat system present within google google has also stated that hangouts is designed to be the future of its telephony product google voice and integrated some of the capabilities of google voice into hangouts history prior to the launch of hangouts google had maintained several similar but technologically separate messaging services and platforms across its suite of products these have included the enterpriseoriented google talk based on xmpp google messenger and the hangouts feature of google which allows for group videoconferencing with up to  users at once however its increasingly fragmented and nonunified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as facebook messenger imessage and whatsapp a decision was made to scrap the existing google talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams following reports that the new service would be known as babel the service officially launched as hangouts during the google io conference on may   on february   google announced it would be discontinuing google talk and instructed users to migrate to the hangouts app on the chrome browser platform in january  google updated the app to tell people not to use it for sms recommending to instead use googles messenger sms app in may  at google io  google announced two new apps google allo an aibased messaging app and google duo a video calling app google has since confirmed that the new apps will not replace hangouts  hangouts will remain a separate product features hangouts allows conversations between two or more users the service can be accessed online through the gmail or google websites or through mobile apps available for android and ios which were distributed as a successor to their existing google talk apps however because it uses a proprietary protocol instead of the xmpp open standard protocol used by google talk most thirdparty applications which had access to google talk do not have access to google hangouts in contrast the gvjackapp for magicjack and the gvmate phone adapter both of which are signallingindependent will not be adversely affected and will continue to work for users as normal using the google hangouts platform after support for xmpp has been terminated chat histories are saved online allowing them to be synced between devices a watermark of a users avatar is used as a marker to indicate how far they have read into the conversation photos can be shared during conversations which are automatically uploaded into a private google album users can also now use color emoji symbols in their messages as with the previous google hangouts users can also perform a group video chat with up to  users at a time the new google hangouts app on ios integrates a google voice number to some extent but on android the sms support in hangouts doesnt fully integrate with google voice for calls or texts integration was first expected by  but was deprecated in january of  the reason for the delay appears tied into google switching away from the xmpp protocol it used as mentioned above for google chrome users do not need to install a plugin however for internet explorer  the user must install the google talk plugin to be able to use the video features in android  hangouts is integrated with text messages sending and receiving functions which is the default sms app on the nexus  for other android phones users can choose to open the sms function when they download the new version of hangouts via google play sms conversations are shown in a drawer on the left side the update also adds gif support and a new locationsharing button which allows the user to send their gps location to their contacts as of version  september   hangouts includes the ability to make free voice calls to other hangouts users and charges users via preregistered credit to call landline and mobile phones internationally except for calls to the united states and canada which are free of charge currently android users must have both the google hangouts and hangouts dialer apps installed if they wish to call landline or mobile telephone numbers via the public switched telephone network on august   google announced that hangouts on air will be discontinued on september th users will have to utilize youtube live for livestreaming events easter eggs google hangouts includes several easter eggs to surprise users most of the easter eggs will appear on all users of the hangout with the exception of ponystream and the konami code reception as of may  google hangouts faced criticism from the electronic frontier foundation as they felt that google was moving in the wrong direction by shrinking its support for the open standard protocol xmpp the new protocol makes it much more difficult for multichat clients like pidgin and adium to support google hangouts they must reverse engineer the protocol additionally the tight integration of google hangouts to google can lead to the unwilling sharing of personal information to others  google hangouts has a score of  out of  points on the electronic frontier foundations secure messaging scorecard it has received points for having communications encrypted in transit and for having completed a recent independent security audit it is missing points because communications are not encrypted with keys that the provider doesnt have access to users cant verify contacts identities past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen the code is not open to independent review and the security design is not properly documented on november   make use of hailed google hangouts as the best messaging app on android by far
