spamassassin spamassassin is a computer program used for email spam filtering spamassassin uses a variety of spamdetection techniques including dnsbased and fuzzychecksumbased spam detection bayesian filtering external programs blacklists and online databases it is released under the apache license  and is now part of the apache foundation the program can be integrated with the mail server to automatically filter all mail for a site it can also be run by individual users on their own mailbox and integrates with several mail programs spamassassin is highly configurable if used as a systemwide filter it can still be configured to support peruser preferences spamassassin was awarded the linux new media award  as the best linuxbased antispam solution history spamassassin was created by justin mason who had maintained a number of patches against an earlier program named filterplx by mark jeftovic which in turn was begun in august  mason rewrote all of jeftovics code from scratch and uploaded the resulting codebase to sourceforgenet on april   in summer  the project became an apache software foundation project and later officially renamed to apache spamassassin the project involved algorithms developed in part by gary robinson and others methods of usage spamassassin is a perlbased application mailspamassassin in cpan which is usually used to filter all incoming mail for one or several users it can be run as a standalone application or as a subprogram of another application such as milter saexim exiscan mailscanner mimedefang amavis or as a client spamc that communicates with a daemon spamd the clientserver or embedded mode of operation has performance benefits but under certain circumstances may introduce additional security risks typically either variant of the application is set up in a generic mail filter program or it is called directly from a mail user agent that supports this whenever new mail arrives mail filter programs such as procmail can be made to pipe all incoming mail through spamassassin with an adjustment to users procmailrc file operation spamassassin comes with a large set of rules which are applied to determine whether an email is spam or not most rules are based on regular expressions that are matched against the body or header fields of the message but spamassassin also employs a number of other spamfighting techniques the rules are called tests in the spamassassin documentation each test has a score value that will be assigned to a message if it matches the tests criteria the scores can be positive or negative with positive values indicating spam and negative ham nonspam messages a message is matched against all tests and spamassassin combines the results into a global score which is assigned to the message the higher the score the higher the probability that the message is spam spamassassin has an internal configurable score threshold to classify a message as spam usually a message will only be considered as spam if it matches multiple criteria matching just a single test will not usually be enough to reach the threshold if spamassassin considers a message to be spam it can be further rewritten in the default configuration the content of the mail is appended as a mime attachment with a brief excerpt in the message body and a description of the tests which resulted in the mail being classified as spam if the score is lower than the defined settings by default the information about the tests passed and total score is still added to the email headers and can be used in postprocessing for less severe actions such as tagging the mail as suspicious spamassassin allows for a peruser configuration of its behaviour even if installed as systemwide service the configuration can be read from a file or a database in their configuration users can specify individuals whose emails are never considered spam or change the scores for certain rules the user can also define a list of languages which they want to receive mail in and spamassassin then assigns a higher score to all mails that appear to be written in another language spamassassin is based on heuristics pattern recognition and such software exhibits some false positives blocking email that may be entirely innocent hence the need for the software to go through a learning exercise this is similar to heuristic software utilized by credit card issuing banks that will block a credit card number based upon suspicious usage patterns such as a large number of purchases made within a short time period as there is no way to tell the bad guys from the good guys with onehundredpercent accuracy there are going to be mistakes made determining the appropriate category for some email networkbased filtering methods spamassassin also supports more methods can be added reasonably easily by writing a perl plugin for spamassassin bayesian filtering spamassassin by default tries to reinforce its own rules through bayesian filtering but bayesian learning is most effective with actual user input typically the user is expected to feed example spam mails and example ham useful mails to the filter which can then learn the difference between the two for this purpose spamassassin provides the commandline tool salearn which can be instructed to learn a single mail or an entire mailbox as either ham or spam typically the user will move unrecognized spam to a separate folder for a while and then run salearn on the folder of nonspam and on the folder of spam separately alternatively if the mail user agent supports it salearn can be called for individual emails regardless of the method used to perform the learning spamassassins bayesian test will assign a higher score to emails that are similar to previously received spam or more precisely to those emails that are different from nonspam in ways similar to previously received spam emails licensing spamassassin is freeopen source software licensed under the apache license  versions prior to  are duallicensed under the artistic license and the gnu general public license sacompile sacompile is a utility distributed with spamassassin as of version  it compiles a spamassassin ruleset into a deterministic finite automaton that allows spamassassin to use processor power more efficiently testing spamassassin most implementations of spamassassin will trigger on the gtube a byte string similar to the antivirus eicar test file if this string is inserted in an rfc  formatted message and passed through the spamassassin engine spamassassin will trigger with a weight of
