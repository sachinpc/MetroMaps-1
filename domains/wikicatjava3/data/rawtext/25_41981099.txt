tox protocol tox is a peertopeer instant messaging and video calling protocol that offers endtoend encryption the stated goal of the project is to provide secure yet easily accessible communication for everyone a reference implementation of the protocol is published as free and opensource software under the terms of the gnu general public license gpl version  or later history the initial commit to github was pushed on june   by a user named irungentoo prealpha testing binaries were made available for users from february   onwards and nightly builds of tox are published by the jenkins automatron on july   tox entered an alpha stage in development and a redesigned download page was created for the occasion features users are assigned a public and private key and they connect to each other directly in a fully distributed peertopeer network users have the ability to message friends join chat rooms with friends or strangers voicevideo chat and send each other files all traffic over tox is endtoend encrypted using the nacl library which provides authenticated encryption and perfect forward secrecy mainstream tox clients aim to provide support for messaging group messaging voice and video calling voice and video conferencing typing indicators message readreceipts file sharing profile encryption and desktop streaming additional features can be implemented by any client as long as they are supported by the core protocol features that are not related to the core networking system are left up to the client client developers are strongly encouraged to adhere to the tox client standard in order to maintain crossclient compatibility and uphold best security practices architecture core the tox core is a library establishing the protocol and api user frontends or clients are built on the top of the core anyone can create a client utilizing the core technical documents describing the design of the core written by the core developer irungentoo are available publicly protocol the core of tox is an implementation of the tox protocol an example of the application layer of the osi model and arguably the presentation layer implementations of the tox protocol not done by the project exist an example of one being xot tox uses the opus audio format for audio streaming and the vp video compression format for video streaming encryption tox uses the cryptographic primitives present in the nacl crypto library via libsodium specifically tox employs curve for its key exchanges xsalsa for symmetric encryption and poly for macs clients a client is a program that uses the tox core library to communicate with other users of the tox protocol various clients are available for a wide range of systems the following list is incomplete there are also tox protocol plugins for pidgin and miranda ng disassociation with tox foundation at july   tox developers officially announced their disassociation with tox foundation due to a dispute over the misuse of donated funds by tox foundation head and ceo according to lwnnet due to domains being in control of the tox foundation main development of the project was transferred to a new infrastructure servers and new domain reception tox received some significant publicity in its early conceptual stage catching the attention of global online tech news sites on august   tox was number five on githubs top trending list concerns about metadata leaks were raised and developers responded by implementing onion routing for the friendfinding process tox was accepted into the google summer of code as a mentoring organization in  and
