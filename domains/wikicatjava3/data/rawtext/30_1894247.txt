apache harmony apache harmony is a retired open source free java implementation developed by the apache software foundation it was announced in early may  and on october   the board of directors voted to make apache harmony a toplevel project the harmony project achieved as of february   completeness for jse  and  for java se  the android operating system has historically been a major user of harmony however since android nougat it uses openjdk libraries gaining eg some features of java  that is excluding its jvm on october   a vote was started by the project lead tim ellison whether to retire the project the outcome was  to  in favor and the project was retired on november   history initiation the harmony project was initially conceived as an effort to unite all developers of the free java implementations many developers expected that it would be the project above the gnu apache and other communities gnu developers were invited into and participated during the initial preparatory planning incompatibility with gnu classpath despite the impression given by the preparatory planning it was decided not to use the code from gnu classpath and that harmony would use an incompatible license therefore blocking the collaboration between harmony and existing free java projects apache developers would then write the needed classes from scratch and expect necessary large code donations from software companies various misunderstandings at the start of the project and the fact that major companies like ibm proposed to give large amount of existing code created some confusion in the free java community about the real objectives of the project one major point of incompatibility between the gnu classpath and apache harmony projects was their incompatible licenses classpaths gnu general public license with the linking exception versus harmonys apache license difficulties to obtain a tck license from sun on april   the apache software foundation sent an open letter to sun microsystems ceo jonathan schwartz regarding their inability to acquire an acceptable license for the java se  technology compatibility kit tck a test kit needed by the project to demonstrate compatibility with the java se  specification as needed by the sun specification license for java se  what makes the license unacceptable for asf is the fact that it imposes rights restrictions through limits on the field of use available to users of harmony not compliant with the java community process rules sun answered on a company blog that it intended to create an open source implementation of the java platform under gpl including the tck but that their current priority was to make the java platform accessible to the gnulinux community under gpl as quickly as possible this answer triggered some reactions either criticizing sun for not responding in a sufficiently open manner to an open letter or rather apache software foundation some think that asf acted unwisely to aggressively demand something they could have obtained with more diplomacy from sun especially considering the timescale of the opening class library since suns release of openjdk sun has released a specific license to allow to run the tck in the openjdk context for any gpl implementation deriving substantially from openjdk on december   the apache software foundation resigned from the java community process executive committee in protest over the difficulty in obtaining a license acceptable to apache for use with the harmony project use in android sdk the virtual machine that is used in googles android platform dalvik up to version  and android runtime art that followed uses a subset of harmony for the core of its class library however dalvik does not align to java se nor java me class library profiles for example jme classes awt and swing are not supported android  nougat replaced harmony with openjdk disengagement from ibm on october   ibm by far the biggest participant in the project decided to join oracle on the openjdk project effectively shifting its efforts from harmony to the oracle reference implementation bob sutor ibms head of linux and open source blogged that ibm will be shifting its development effort from the apache project harmony to openjdk on march  ibms tim ellison announced that he resigned as project management chair for harmony a move which brought questions about the future of the project since the beginning of  there has been almost no more development on the project nor discussions on the mailing list end of the project on october   a poll was started on the harmonydev mailing list by the project lead tim ellison whether to retire the project the outcome on november  was  to  in favor of retirement on november   the apache software foundation board of directors passed a motion to terminate the project one director larry rosen cast a no vote based on the timing rather than the merits of the proposal it was otherwise unanimous the project was retired on november   development team at the start apache harmony received some large code contributions from several companies development discussions have taken place on open mailing lists later the apache software foundation mentors put a lot of effort into bringing the development process more in line with the apache way and it seemed that their efforts were successful last development status apache harmony was accepted among the official apache projects on october   architecture the dynamic runtime layer virtual machine consists of the following components support platform and operating system the project provided a portable implementation that ease development on many platforms and operating systems the main focus was on windows and linux operating systems on x and x architectures class library coverage the expected donations from software companies were actually received the apache harmony now contains the working code including the swing awt and java d code which were contributed by intel the harmony project currently achieve as of february   completeness for jdk  and  for java se  the progress of the apache harmony project can be tracked against jse  and java se  also there is a branch for harmony v in development for java se  apache harmony developers integrate several existing fieldtested opensource projects to meet their goal not reinventing the wheel many of these projects are mature and well known and other parts of the library needed to be written from scratch this is a list of existing open source components that are used in the apache harmony project some of them were in use before the project started documentation harmony is currently less documented than the alternative free java implementations for instance in gnu classpath every method of the central corba class orb has the explaining comment both in the standard abstract api class and implementation in the yoko project used by harmony most methods both in the standard declaration and implementing class were undocumented at the end of october  also gnu classpath supported both older and current corba features same as suns implementation harmony differently left the central method of the older standard codice fully unimplemented tools a complete implementation of the java platform also needs a compiler that translates java source code into bytecodes a program that manages jar files a debugger and an applet viewer and web browser plugin to name a few harmony currently has the compiler appletviewer jarsigner javah javap keytool policytool and unpack  virtual machine support harmony currently has seven virtual machine implementations that run harmony class library all of which were donations by external groups in the end of november  the language support provided by these virtual machine was still incomplete and the build instructions recommended to use ibms proprietary j instead to run the class library test suite however this is not necessary anymore as of july  as for the rest of the project drlvm virtual machine development has now stalled as of may  application status since its conception harmony grew in its ability to execute nontrivial java applications  supported applications include however harmonys incomplete library prevented it from launching some other applications
