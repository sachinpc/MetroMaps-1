mono software mono is a free and open source project led by xamarin a subsidiary of microsoft formerly by novell and originally by ximian to create an ecma standardcompliant net frameworkcompatible set of tools including among others a c compiler and a common language runtime the logo of mono is a stylized monkeys face mono being spanish for monkey the stated purpose of mono is not only to be able to run microsoft net applications crossplatform but also to bring better development tools to linux developers mono can be run on many software systems including android most linux distributions bsd os x windows solaris and even some game consoles such as playstation  wii and xbox  the mono project has been controversial within the opensource community as it implements portions of net framework that may be covered by microsoft patents although standardized portions of net framework are covered under microsofts open specification promisea covenant stating that microsoft would not assert its patents against implementations of its specifications under certain conditions other portions are not which led to concerns that the mono project could become the target of patent infringement lawsuits following microsofts open sourcing of several core net technologies since  and its acquisition of xamarin in the beginning of  an updated patent promise has been issued for the mono project see below history when microsoft first announced their net framework in june  it was described as a new platform based on internet standards and in december of that year the underlying common language infrastructure was published as an open standard ecma opening up the potential for independent implementations miguel de icaza of ximian believed that net had the potential to increase programmer productivity and began investigating whether a linux version was feasible recognizing that their small team could not expect to build and support a full product they launched the mono open source project on july   at the oreilly conference after three years development mono  was released on june   mono evolved from its initial focus of a developer platform for linux desktop applications to supporting a wide range of architectures and operating systems  including embedded systems after novell was acquired by attachmate in april  attachmate announced hundreds of layoffs for the novell workforce putting in question the future of mono on may  miguel de icaza announced in his blog that mono would continue to be supported by xamarin a company he founded after being laid off from novell the original mono team had also moved to the new company xamarin planned to keep working on mono and had planned to rewrite the commercial net stacks for ios and android from scratch because novell still owned monotouch and mono for android at the time after this announcement the future of the project was questioned monotouch and mono for android being in direct competition with the existing commercial offerings now owned by attachmate and considering that the xamarin team would have difficulties proving that they did not use technologies they formerly developed when they were employed by novell for the same work however in july  novell now a subsidiary of attachmate and xamarin announced that it granted a perpetual license to xamarin for mono monotouch and mono for android which officially took stewardship of the project current status and roadmap monos current version is   this version provides the core api of the net framework and support for visual basicnet and c versions   and  linq to objects xml and sql are part of the distribution c  is now the default mode of operation for the c compiler windows forms  is also supported but not actively developed and as such its support on mono is incomplete version  is the first version that incorporates microsoft original source code that was released by microsoft as part of the net core project monos aim is to achieve full support for the features in net  except windows presentation foundation wpf which the mono team do not plan to support due to the amount of work it would need windows workflow foundation wf limited windows communication foundation wcf some missing parts of the net framework are under development in an experimental mono subproject called olive the mono project has also created a visual basic net compiler and a runtime designed for running vbnet applications it is currently being developed by rolf bjarne kvinge moonlight an open source implementation of microsoft silverlight called moonlight has been included since mono  moonlight  which supports the silverlight  apis was released january   moonlight  supports silverlight  and some features of silverlight  a preview release of moonlight  was announced in february  and contains updates to silverlight  support the moonlight project was abandoned on may   according to miguel two factors sealed the fate of the project microsoft added artificial restrictions that made it useless for desktop programming and the technology had not gained enough traction on the web mono components mono consists of three groups of components the core components include the c compiler the virtual machine for the common language infrastructure and the core class libraries these components are based on the ecma and ecma standards allowing mono to provide a standards compliant free and open source cli virtual machine microsoft issued a statement that covers both standards under their community promise license the monolinuxgnome development stack provide tools for application development while using the existing gnome and free and open source libraries these include gtk for graphical user interface gui development mozilla libraries for working with the gecko rendering engine unix integration libraries monoposix database connectivity libraries a security stack and the xml schema language relaxng gtk allows mono applications to integrate into the gnome desktop as native applications the database libraries provide connectivity to the objectrelational database dbo firebird microsoft sql server mssql mysql open database connectivity odbc oracle postgresql sqlite and many others the mono project tracks developing database components at its website the microsoft compatibility stack provides a pathway for porting windows net applications to gnulinux this group of components include adonet aspnet and windows forms among others as these components are not covered by ecma standards some of them remain subject to patent fears and concerns framework architecture the major components of mono include code execution engine the mono runtime contains a code execution engine that translates ecma cil byte codes into native code and supports a number of processors arm mips in bit mode only sparc powerpc s in bit mode x x and ia for bit modes the code generator is exposed in three modes starting with mono  it is possible to configure mono to use the llvm as the code generation engine instead of monos own code generation engine this is useful for high performance computing loads and other situations where the execution performance is more important than the startup performance starting with the mono  preview it is no longer necessary to pick one engine over the other at configuration time the code generation engine can be selected at startup by using the codice or codice command line arguments and it defaults to the fast mono code generation engine garbage collector as of mono  the mono runtime ships with two garbage collectors a generational collector and the boehm conservative collector the default garbage collector prior to mono  the boehmdemersweiser conservative garbage collector has significant limitations compared to commercial garbagecollected runtimes like the java virtual machine or the net frameworks runtime because the garbage collector can exhibit memory leaks on certain classes of applications it may be unsuitable for longrunning server applications  a new generational collector called the simple generational gc sgengc became available as part of mono starting with mono  this is the default for versions of mono from  to  users can elect to use the sgen garbage collector by passing the codice switch to the mono runtime at startup this new garbage collector has many advantages over a traditional conservative scanner it uses generational garbage collection where new objects are allocated from a nursery during the garbage collection cycle all objects that survived are migrated to an older generation memory pool the idea being that many objects are transient and can quickly be collected and only a handful of objects are longterm objects that live for the entire life of the application to improve performance this collector assigns memory pools to each thread to let threads allocate new memory blocks without having to coordinate with other threads migration of objects from the nursery to the old generation is done by copying the data from the nursery to the old generation pool and updating any live pointers that point to the data to point to the new location this can be expensive for large objects so monos sgen uses a separate pool of memory for large objects large object section and uses a markandsweep algorithm for those objects currently sgen treats the stack and registers conservatively and pins any objects that could be referenced by any of these roots the upcoming version of mono scans the managed stack precisely reducing the number of pinned objects class library the class library provides a comprehensive set of facilities for application development they are primarily written in c but due to the common language specification they can be used by any net language the class library is structured into namespaces and deployed in shared libraries known as assemblies speaking of the net framework is primarily referring to this class library namespaces and assemblies namespaces are a mechanism for logically grouping similar classes into a hierarchical structure this prevents naming conflicts the structure is implemented using dotseparated words where the most common toplevel namespace is system such as systemio and systemnet there are other toplevel namespaces as well such as accessibility and windows a user can define a namespace by placing elements inside a namespace block assemblies are the physical packaging of the class libraries these are dll files just like but not to be confused with win shared libraries examples of assemblies are mscorlibdll systemdll systemdatadll and accessibilitydll namespaces are often distributed among several assemblies and one assembly can be composed of several files common language infrastructure and common language specification the common language infrastructure cli or more commonly known as the common language runtime is implemented by the mono executable the runtime is used to execute compiled net applications the common language infrastructure is defined by the ecma standard to run an application you must invoke the runtime with the relevant parameters the common language specification cls is specified in chapter  of ecma and defines the interface to the cli such as conventions like the underlying types for enum the mono compiler generates an image that conforms to the cls this is the common intermediate language the mono runtime takes this image and runs it the ecma standard formally defines a library that conforms to the cls as a framework managed and unmanaged code within a native netmono application all code is managed that is it is governed by the clis style of memory management and thread safety other net or mono applications can use legacy code which is referred to as unmanaged by using the systemruntimeinteropservices libraries to create c bindings many libraries which ship with mono use this feature of the cli such as gtk monospecific innovations mono has innovated in some areas with new extensions to the core c and cli specifications in addition mono is available on a variety of operating systems and architectures system requirements windows xp windows vista windows  windows  windows  windows  macosx or linux related projects several projects extend mono and allow developers to use it in their development environment these projects include crossplatform mac os x mobile platforms windows other implementations microsoft has a version of net  now available only for windows xp called the shared source cli rotor microsofts shared source license may be insufficient for the needs of the community it explicitly forbids commercial use free software foundations decommissioned portablenet project monodevelop monodevelop is a free gnome integrated development environment primarily designed for c and other net languages such as nemerle boo and java via ikvmnet although it also supports languages such as c c python and vala monodevelop was originally a port of sharpdevelop to gtk but it has since evolved to meet the needs of mono developers the ide includes class management builtin help code completion stetic a gui designer project support and an integrated debugger the monodoc browser provides access to api documentation and code samples the documentation browser uses wikistyle content management allowing developers to edit and improve the documentation xamarinios and xamarinandroid xamarinios and xamarinandroid both developed by xamarin are implementations of mono for iphone and androidbased smartphones previously available only for commercial licensing after microsofts acquisition of xamarin in  the mono runtime itself was relicensed under mit license and both xamarinios and xamarinandroid are being made free and open source xamarinios xamarinios previously named monotouch is a proprietary library that allows developers to create c and net based applications that run on the iphone ipod and ipad devices it is based on the mono framework and developed in conjunction with novell unlike mono applications xamarinios apps are compiled down to machine code targeted specifically at the apple iphone and ipad this is necessary because the ios kernel prevents justintime compilers from executing on the device the xamarinios stack is made up of xamarin studio is used as the primary ide however additional links to xcode and the ios simulator have been written from april to early september  the future of monotouch was put in doubt as apple introduced new terms for iphone developers that apparently prohibits them from developing in languages other than c c and objectivec and the use of a middle layer between the ios platform and iphone applications this made the future of monotouch and other technologies such as unity uncertain then in september  apple rescinded this restriction stating that they were relaxing the language restrictions that they had put in place earlier that year xamarinandroid xamarinandroid formerly known as mono for android initially developed by novell and continued by xamarin is a proprietary implementation of mono for androidbased smartphones it was first released on april   mono for android was developed to allow developers to more easily write crossplatform applications that will run on all mobile platforms in an interview with honline miguel de icaza stated our vision is to allow developers to reuse their engine and business logic code across all mobile platforms and swapping out the user interface code for a platformspecific api in august  a microsoft spokesman tom hanrahan of microsofts open source technology centre stated in reference to the lawsuit filed by oracle against google over androids use of java that the type of action oracle is taking against google over java is not going to happen if a net port to android was through mono it would fall under the microsoft community promise agreement the xamarinandroid stack consists of the following components license mono is dual licensed by xamarin similar to other products such as qt and the mozilla application suite monos c compiler and tools are released under the gnu general public license gplv only starting with version  of mono the mono c compiler source code will also be available under the mit x license the runtime libraries under the gnu lesser general public license lgplv only and the class libraries under the mit license these are all free software and opensource licenses and hence mono is free and opensource software the license of the c compiler was changed from the gpl to the mit x license to allow the compiler code to be reused in a few instances where the gpl would have prevented such on march   microsofts acquisition of xamarin was officially closed on march   microsoft announced at microsoft build that theyll completely relicense mono under the mit license even in scenarios where previously a commercial license was necessary and microsoft stated that they wont assert any applicable patents against parties that are using selling offering for sale importing or distributing mono mono and microsofts patents monos implementation of those components of the net stack not submitted to the ecma for standardization has been the source of patent violation concerns for much of the life of the project in particular discussion has taken place about whether microsoft could destroy the mono project through patent suits this discussion is now moot after microsoft acquired xamarin the primary maintainers of mono in june  the ubuntu technical board stated that it saw no reason to exclude mono or applications based upon it from the archive or from the default installation set the base technologies submitted to the ecma and therefore also the unixgnomespecific parts are claimed to be safe due to microsofts explicitly placing both ecma  c and ecma  cli standards under the microsoft community promise the concerns primarily relate to technologies developed by microsoft on top of the net framework such as aspnet adonet and windows forms see nonstandardized namespaces ie parts composing monos windows compatibility stack these technologies are today not fully implemented in mono and not required for developing monoapplications they are simply there for developers and users who need full compatibility with the windows system should patent issues ever arise the mono projects stated strategy for dealing with them is as follows in addition mono is also included in the list of software that the open invention network has sworn to protect on july   microsoft announced that it was placing their ecma  and ecma  specifications under their community promise pledging that they would not assert their patents against anyone implementing distributing or using alternative implementations of net however their position regarding the nonecma components like aspnet adonet and windows forms which are the bone of contention remains unclarified the free software foundations richard stallman has stated in that we should discourage people from writing programs in c therefore we should not include c implementations in the default installation of gnulinux distributions or in their principal ways of installing gnome in  brett smith also from the fsf stated that microsofts patents are much more dangerous its the only major software company that has declared itself the enemy of gnulinux and stated its intention to attack our community with patents c represents a unique threat to us and the community promise does nothing to change any of this fedora project leader paul frields has stated we do have some serious concerns about mono and well continue to look at it with our legal counsel to see what if any steps are needed on our part yet we havent come to a legal conclusion that is pat enough for us to make the decision to take mono out in november  at a ubuntu developer summit developers voted to have the monobased banshee media player removed from ubuntus default installation beginning on ubuntu  although reported reasonings included performance issues on arm architecture blocking issues on its gtk  version and it being in their opinion not well maintained speculation also surfaced that the decision was also influenced by a desire to remove mono from the base distribution as the remaining programs dependent on mono gbrainy and tomboy were also to be removed mono developer joseph michael shields defended the performance of banshee on arm and also the claims that banshee was not wellmaintained as being a directed personal insult to one of its major contributors on march   microsoft announced at microsoft build following the previous acquisition of xamarin that they will completely relicense mono under the mit license microsoft issued the patent promise for mono stating that they wont assert any applicable patents against parties that are using selling offering for sale importing or distributing mono it was also announced that xamarin had contributed the mono project to the net foundation these developments cancel many of the previous patent violation concerns related to the mono project they seem to be a logical continuation of the microsofts shift towards more supportive attitude to open software which has begun by open sourcing the net compiler platform roslyn and the aspnet on april  and later the net core open sourced on november  and other software software developed with mono many programs covering a range of applications have been developed using the mono application programming interface api and c some programs written for the linux desktop include banshee beagle docky fspot gbrainy gnome do monotorrent pinta and tomboy a number of video games such as the sims  and second lifes for their scripting languages opensimulator virtual world server or games built with the unity or monogame game engines also make use of mono
