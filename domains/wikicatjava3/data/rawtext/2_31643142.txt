ch computer programming ch is a proprietary crossplatform c and c interpreter and scripting language environment originally designed by harry h cheng as a scripting language for beginners to learn mathematics computing numerical analysis numeric methods and programming in cc ch is now developed and marketed by softintegration inc a student edition is freely available ch can be embedded in cc application programs it has numerical computing and graphical plotting features ch is a combined shell and ide ch shell combines the features of common shell and c language chide provides quick code navigation and symbolic debugging it is based on embedded ch scite and scintilla ch is written in c and runs on windows linux os x freebsd aix solaris qnx and hpux it supports c and major c features but it does not support the full set of c features c complex number ieee floatingpoint arithmetic and variablelength array features were supported in ch before they became part of the c standard an article published by computer reseller news crn named ch as notable among cbased virtual machines for its functionality and the availability of thirdparty libraries ch has many toolkits that extend its functions for example ch mechanism toolkit is used for design and analysis of commonly used mechanisms such as fourbar linkage fivebar linkage sixbar linkage crankslider mechanism and camfollower system ch control system toolkit is used for modeling design and analysis of continuoustime or discretetime linear time invariant lti control systems both toolkits includes the source code ch is now used and integrated into curriculum by many high schools and universities to teach computing and programming in cc features ch supports the  iso c standard c and c classes it is a superset of c with c classes several major features of c are supported such as complex numbers variable length arrays vlas ieee floatingpoint arithmetic and generic mathematical functions the specification for wide characters in addendum  for c is also supported c features available in ch include ch can interact with existing cc libraries and call cc functions from ch script as a cc interpreter ch can be used as a scripting engine and extension language for applications pointers to arrays or variables can be passed and shared in both ccompiled and ch scripting contexts one example of an embedded ch scripting application is mobilec which has been used for collaborative visualization of distributed mesh model ch has a builtin string type stringt for automatic memory allocation and deallocation it supports shell aliases history piping etc ch has builtin dd graphical plotting features and computational arrays for numerical computing a d linear equation of the form b  ax can be written verbatim in ch
