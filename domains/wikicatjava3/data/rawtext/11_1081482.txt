high performance fortran high performance fortran hpf is an extension of fortran  with constructs that support parallel computing published by the high performance fortran forum hpff the hpff was convened and chaired by ken kennedy of rice university the first version of the hpf report was published in  building on the array syntax introduced in fortran  hpf uses a data parallel model of computation to support spreading the work of a single array computation over multiple processors this allows efficient implementation on both simd and mimd style architectures hpf features included fortran  incorporated several hpf capabilities in response the hpff again convened and published the hpf  report the updated report removed material which was already covered by fortran  the report was also reorganized and revised based on experience with hpf  while some vendors did incorporate hpf into their compilers in the s some aspects proved difficult to implement and of questionable use since then most vendors and users have moved to openmpbased parallel processing however hpf continues to have influence for example the proposed codice data type for the upcoming fortran standard contains a number of new intrinsic functions taken directly from hpf
