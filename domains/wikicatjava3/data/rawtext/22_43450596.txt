fraunhofer fdk aac fraunhofer fdk aac full title fraunhofer fdk aac codec library for android is an opensource software library for encoding and decoding advanced audio coding aac format audio developed by fraunhofer iis and included as part of android it supports several audio object types including mpeg and mpeg aac lc heaac aac lc  sbr heaacv lc  sbr  ps as well aacld low delay and aaceld enhanced low delay for realtime communication the encoding library supports sample rates up to khz and up to eight channels  surround the androidtargeted implementation of the fraunhofer aac encoder uses fixedpoint math and is optimized for lowdelay encoding on embedded devicesmobile phones the library is currently limited to bit pcm input other versions of the fraunhofer encoder like the one included in winamp are optimized for encoding music on desktopclass processors those versions of the encoder however are not open source and require a commercial license the license included by fraunhofer in the fdk library source code allows redistribution in source or binary forms but does not license patented technologies described by the code the license states that the library may only be distributed as authorized by patent licenses this restriction along with a limitation on charging for software that includes the library makes it nonfree by most standards the fdk aac encoder employs a more aggressive default lowpass filter than is used in other codecs higher frequencies are removed so that more bits are available to better describe sounds of lower frequencies improving the overall quality for most combinations of recordings and listeners in some not completely rare combinations the missing high frequencies are noticeable the library allows overriding the lowpass filter setting and in the highest vbr mode effectively applies no filter at all a crossplatform source distribution is maintained by martin storsj as fdkaac the latest fdkaac release is   based on fdk version  encoderdecoder the code compiles into a shared library libfdkaac an opensource commandline interface frontend to the libfdkaac encoder exists called fdkaac the current version is  the media frameworks ffmpeg and libav support audio encoding through libfdkaac until version  february  ffmpeg recommended fdk for aac encoding over its native encoder while the native encoder has become stable and good enough for common use fdk is still considered the highest quality encoder available for use with ffmpeg
