eclipse software eclipse is an integrated development environment ide used in computer programming and is the most widely used java ide it contains a base workspace and an extensible plugin system for customizing the environment eclipse is written mostly in java and its primary use is for developing java applications but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages through the use of plugins including ada abap c c cobol d fortran haskell javascript julia lasso lua natural perl php prolog python r ruby including ruby on rails framework rust scala clojure groovy scheme and erlang it can also be used to develop documents with latex through the use of the texlipse plugin and packages for the software mathematica development environments include the eclipse java development tools jdt for java and scala eclipse cdt for and eclipse pdt for php among others the initial codebase originated from ibm visualage the eclipse software development kit sdk which includes the java development tools is meant for java developers users can extend its abilities by installing plugins written for the eclipse platform such as development toolkits for other programming languages and can write and contribute their own plugin modules released under the terms of the eclipse public license eclipse sdk is free and opensource software although it is incompatible with the gnu general public license it was one of the first ides to run under gnu classpath and it runs without problems under icedtea history eclipse was inspired by the smalltalkbased visualage family of integrated development environment ide products although fairly successful a major drawback of the visualage products was that developed code was not in a component model instead all code for a project was held in a compressed lump somewhat like a zip file but in a proprietary format called dat individual classes could not be easily accessed certainly not outside the tool a team primarily at the ibm cary nc lab developed the new product as a javabased replacement in november  a consortium was formed with a board of stewards to further the development of eclipse as opensource software it is estimated that ibm had already invested close to  million by that time the original members were borland ibm merant qnx software systems rational software red hat suse togethersoft and webgain the number of stewards increased to over  by the end of  in january  the eclipse foundation was created eclipse  released on  june  selected the osgi service platform specifications as the runtime architecture the association for computing machinery recognized eclipse with the  acm software systems award on  april  licensing the eclipse public license epl is the fundamental license under which eclipse projects are released some projects require dual licensing for which the eclipse distribution license edl is available although use of this license must be applied for and is considered on a casebycase basis eclipse was originally released under the common public license but was later relicensed under the eclipse public license the free software foundation has said that both licenses are free software licenses but are incompatible with the gnu general public license gpl name according to lee nackman chief technology officer of ibms rational division originating in  at that time the name eclipse dating from at least  was not a wordplay on sun microsystems as the products primary competition at the time of naming was microsoft visual studio which it eclipse was to eclipse different versions of eclipse have been named after different sciencerelated names the versions named after callisto europa and ganymede which are moons of jupiter were followed by a version named after galileo the discoverer of those moons these were followed by two sunthemed names helios of greek mythology and indigo one of the seven colors of a rainbow which is produced by the sun the version after that juno has a triple meaning a roman mythological figure an asteroid and a spacecraft to jupiter kepler luna and mars continued the astronomy theme whereupon a new theme of chemical elements commenced with neon and oxygen releases since  the foundation has coordinated an annual simultaneous release each release includes the eclipse platform as well as a number of other eclipse projects architecture eclipse uses plugins to provide all the functionality within and on top of the runtime system its runtime system is based on equinox an implementation of the osgi core framework specification in addition to allowing the eclipse platform to be extended using other programming languages such as c and python the plugin framework allows the eclipse platform to work with typesetting languages like latex and networking applications such as telnet and database management systems the plugin architecture supports writing any desired extension to the environment such as for configuration management java and cvs support is provided in the eclipse sdk with support for other version control systems provided by thirdparty plugins with the exception of a small runtime kernel everything in eclipse is a plugin this means that every plugin developed integrates with eclipse in exactly the same way as other plugins in this respect all features are created equal eclipse provides plugins for a wide variety of features some of which are through third parties using both free and commercial models examples of plugins include for uml for sequence and other uml diagrams a plugin for db explorer and many others the eclipse sdk includes the eclipse java development tools jdt offering an ide with a builtin incremental java compiler and a full model of the java source files this allows for advanced refactoring techniques and code analysis the ide also makes use of a workspace in this case a set of metadata over a flat filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding workspace resource is refreshed afterwards eclipse implements the graphical control elements of the java toolkit called standard widget toolkit swt whereas most java applications use the java standard abstract window toolkit awt or swing eclipses user interface also uses an intermediate graphical user interface layer called jface which simplifies the construction of applications based on swt eclipse was made to run on wayland during a gsocproject in  language packs being developed by the babel project provide translations into over a dozen natural languages rich client platform eclipse provides the rich client platform rcp for developing general purpose applications the following components constitute the rich client platform examples of rich client applications based on eclipse are server platform eclipse supports development for tomcat glassfish and many other servers and is often capable of installing the required server for development directly from the ide it supports remote debugging allowing the user to watch variables and step through the code of an application that is running on the attached server web tools platform the eclipse web tools platform wtp project is an extension of the eclipse platform with tools for developing web and java ee applications it includes source and graphical editors for a variety of languages wizards and builtin applications to simplify development and tools and apis to support deploying running and testing apps modeling platform the modeling project contains all the official projects of the eclipse foundation focusing on modelbased development technologies they are all compatible with the eclipse modeling framework created by ibm those projects are separated in several categories model transformation model development tools concrete syntax development abstract syntax development technology and research and amalgam model transformation projects uses emf based models as an input and produce either a model or text as an output model to model transformation projects includes atl an open source transformation language and toolkit used to transform a given model or to generate a new model from a given emf model model to text transformation projects contains acceleo an implementation of mofmt a standard model to text language from the object management group omg acceleo is an open source code generator that can generate any textual language java php python etc from emf based models defined with any metamodel uml sysml etc model development tools projects are implementations of modeling standard used in the industry like uml or ocl and their toolkit among those projects can be found implementations of the following standards the concrete syntax development project contains the graphical modeling framework an eclipsebased framework dedicated to the graphical representation of emf based models the abstract syntax development project hosts the eclipse modeling framework core of most of the modeling project of the eclipse foundation and the framework available for emf like cdo emf query or emf validation technology and research projects are prototypes of modeling project this project is used to host all the modeling projects of the eclipse foundation during their incubation phase amalgam provides the packaging and integration between all the available modeling tools for the eclipse package dedicated to modeling tools extensions eclipse supports a rich selection of extensions adding support for python via pydev android development via googles adt javafx support via efxclipse and many others at the eclipse marketplace as well as javascript and jquery valable is a vala plugin for eclipse alternative distributions a number of alternative distributions exist in the eclipse project eclipse pdt php development tools the php php hypertext preprocessor development tools project provides a php development tools framework for the eclipse platform the project encompasses all development components including codecompletion develop php and facilitate extensibility it leverages the existing eclipse web tools platform wtp and dynamic languages toolkit dltk eclipse adt android development tools android development tools adt is a googleprovided plugin for the eclipse ide that is designed to provide an integrated environment in which to build android applications adt extends the capabilities of eclipse to let developers set up new android projects create an application ui add packages based on the android framework api debug their applications using the android sdk tools and export signed or unsigned apk files in order to distribute their applications it is free download it was the official ide for android but was replaced by android studio based on intellij idea community edition
