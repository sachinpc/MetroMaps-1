jxta jxta juxtapose is an open source peertopeer protocol specification begun by sun microsystems in  the jxta protocols are defined as a set of xml messages which allow any device connected to a network to exchange messages and collaborate independently of the underlying network topology as jxta is based upon a set of open xml protocols it can be implemented in any modern computer language implementations are currently available for java se cc c and java me the c version uses the cc native bindings and is not a complete reimplementation in its own right jxta peers create a virtual overlay network which allows a peer to interact with other peers even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and nats or use different network transports in addition each resource is identified by a unique id a  bit sha urn in the java binding so that a peer can change its localization address while keeping a constant identification number jxta strongly resembles chimera categories of peers jxta defines two main categories of peers edge peers and superpeers the superpeers can be further divided into rendezvous and relay peers each peer has a well defined role in the jxta peertopeer model any peer in a jxta network can be a rendezvous or relay as soon as they have the necessary credentials or networkstoragememorycpu requirements advertisements an advertisement is an xml document which describes any resource in a pp network peers groups pipes services etc the communication in jxta can be thought as the exchange of one or more advertisements through the network pipes pipes are a virtual communication channel used by jxta to exchange messages and data pipes are asynchronous unreliable and unidirectional there are basically three types of pipes peer groups a peer group provides a scope for message propagation and a logical clustering of peers in jxta every peer is a member of a default group netpeergroup but a given peer can be member of many subgroups at the same time a peer may play different roles in different groups it may act as an edge peer in one group but a rendezvous in another each group should have at least one rendezvous peer and it is not possible to send messages between two groups rendezvous network the rendezvous peers have an optimized routing mechanism which allows an efficient propagation of messages pushed by edge peers connected to them this is achieved through the use of a loosely consistent network each rendezvous peer maintains a rendezvous peer view rpv a list of known rendezvous peers ordered by the peer id there is not any mechanism to enforce the consistency of all rpvs across the jxta network so a given rpv can have a temporary or permanent inconsistent view of the other rendezvous peers as soon as there is a low churn rate that is a stable network where peers dont join or leave too frequently the rpv list of each peer will converge as each rendezvous peer exchange a random subset of its rpv with other rendezvous peers from time to time when an edge peer publishes an advertisement the index of this advertisement is pushed to the rendezvous through a system called shared resource distributed index srdi after that the rendezvous applies a distributed hash table dht function so that it can forward the index to another peer in the rpv list for replication purposes it will send this index to the neighbours of the chosen rendezvous peer in the rpv list the lookup process requires the use of the same dht function to discover the rendezvous peer which is in charge of storing that index once the rendezvous peer is reached it will forward the query to the edge peer which published the advertisement and this peer will get in touch with the peer which issues the query if the dht function cannot find a peer which is in charge of the advertisement then the query will be forwarded up and down the rpv list until a match is found the query is aborted or it reaches the limits of the rpv list this process is called random walk status in november  oracle officially announced its withdrawal from the jxta projects as of august  the jxta project has not yet been continued or otherwise announced to retain operations neither a decision was made on the assembly of its board nor an answer by oracle regarding a pending request to move the sourcecode to apache license version
