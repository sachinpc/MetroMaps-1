connected device configuration the connected device configuration cdc is a specification of a framework for java me applications describing the basic set of libraries and virtualmachine features that must be present in an implementation the cdc is combined with one or more profiles to give developers a platform for building applications on embedded devices ranging from pagers up to settop boxes the cdc was developed under the java community process as jsr  cdc  and jsr  cdc  typical requirements devices that support cdc typically include a bit cpu with about mb of ram and mb of rom available for the java application environment the reference implementations for cdc profiles are based on linux running on an intelcompatible pc and optimized implementations are available for a variety of other cpus and operating systems profiles a profile is a set of apis that support devices with different capabilities and resources within the cdc framework to provide a complete java application environment three profiles are available which build on each other incrementally and allow application developers to choose the appropriate programming model for a particular device foundation profile this is the most basic of the cdc family of profiles foundation profile is a set of java apis tuned for lowfootprint devices that have limited resources that do not need a graphical user interface system it provides a complete java me application environment for consumer products and embedded devices but without a standardsbased gui system version  is specified in jsr  and implements a subset of java se  including a set of securityrelated optional packages such as java authentication and authorization service jaas java secure socket extension jsse and java cryptography extension jce personal basis profile the personal basis profile provides a superset of the foundation profile apis and supports a similar set of devices with lightweight graphical user interface requirements a framework for building lightweight graphical user interface components is provided with support for some awt classes there are no heavyweight gui components provided because these components assume the availability of a pointing device such as a mouse the specification is described in jsr  and is used for products that require a standardsbased graphical user interface but without full awt compatibility the xlet application programming model is used for application development within this profile including advanced content on bluray discs conforming to the bdj specification personal profile the personal profile extends the personal basis profile with a gui toolkit based on awt it provides a complete java me application environment with full awt support and is intended for higher end devices such as pdas smart communicators settop boxes game consoles automobile dashboard electronics and so on this is the recommended profile for porting of legacy personaljavabased applications the specification is described in jsr  and uses the applet programming model for application development optional packages cdc supports a number of optional packages that allow developers to access specific pieces of extra functionality within the restricted resource constraints of a java me device
