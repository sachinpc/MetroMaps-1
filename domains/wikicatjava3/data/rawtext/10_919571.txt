nesl nesl is a parallel programming language developed at carnegie mellon by the scandal project and released in  it integrates various ideas from parallel algorithms and functional programming and array programming languages the most important new ideas behind nesl are the main design guideline for nesl was to make parallel programming easy and portable algorithms are typically significantly more concise in nesl than in most other parallel programming languages and the code closely resembles highlevel pseudocode nesl supports nested data parallelism by using the flattening transform to convert nested data parallelism to flat data parallelism this works by storing nested vectors as the nested data and a segment descriptor of vector lengths separately this flattening transform however can increase the asymptotic work and space complexity of the original program leading to a much less efficient result influences nesl heavily influenced data parallel haskell
