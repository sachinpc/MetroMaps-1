apache beam apache beam is an open source unified programming model to define and execute data processing pipelines including etl batch and stream continuous processing beam pipelines are defined using one of the provided sdks and executed in one of the beams supported runners distributed processing backends including apache flink apache spark and google cloud dataflow it has been termed an uberapi for big data history apache beam is one implementation of the dataflow model paper the dataflow model is based on previous work on distributed processing abstractions at google in particular on flumejava and millwheel google released an open sdk implementation of the dataflow model in  and an environment to execute dataflows locally nondistributed as well as in the google cloud platform service in  google donated the core sdk as well as the implementation of a local runner and a set of ios data connectors to access google cloud platform data services to the apache software foundation other companies and members of the community have contributed runners for existing distributed execution platforms as well as new ios to integrate the beam runners with existing databases keyvalue stores and message systems additionally new dsls have been proposed to support specific domain needs on top of the beam model
