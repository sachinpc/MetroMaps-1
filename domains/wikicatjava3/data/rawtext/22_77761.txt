flac flac  free lossless audio codec is an audio coding format for lossless compression of digital audio and is also the name of the reference codec implementation digital audio compressed by flacs algorithm can typically be reduced to  of its original size and decompress to an identical copy of the original audio data flac is an open format with royaltyfree licensing and a reference implementation which is free software flac has support for metadata tagging album cover art and fast seeking since the introduction of flac in  the number of products and services using the format has increased it is generally supported by more hardware devices than competing lossless compressed formats that may have intellectual property constraints history development was started in  by josh coalson the bitstream format was frozen when flac entered beta stage with the release of version  of the reference implementation on  january  version  was released on  july  on  january  the xiphorg foundation and the flac project announced the incorporation of flac under the xiphorg banner xiphorg is behind other free compression formats such as vorbis theora speex and opus version  was released on  may  at which point development was moved to the xiphorg git repository composition the flac project consists of the specification of the stream format can be implemented by anyone without prior permission xiphorg reserves the right to set the flac specification and certify compliance and neither the flac format nor any of the implemented encoding or decoding methods are covered by any patent the reference implementation is free software the source code for libflac and libflac is available under the bsd license and the sources for codice codice and the plugins are available under the gnu general public license in its stated goals the flac project encourages its developers not to implement copy prevention features drm of any kind design audio sources encoded to flac are typically reduced to  of their original size similar to other lossless formats compression levels libflac uses a compression level parameter that varies from  fastest to  smallest the compressed files are always perfect lossless representations of the original data although the compression process involves a tradeoff between speed and size the decoding process is always quite fast and not very dependent on the level of compression comparison to other formats flac is specifically designed for efficient packing of audio data unlike generalpurpose lossless algorithms such as deflate which is used in zip and gzip while zip may reduce the size of a cdquality audio file by  flac is able to reduce the size of audio data by  by taking advantage of the characteristics of audio the technical strengths of flac compared to other lossless formats lie in its ability to be streamed and decoded quickly independent of compression level in a comparison of compressed audio formats ffmpegs flac implementation was noted to have the fastest and most efficient embedded decoder of any modern lossless audio format since flac is a lossless scheme it is suitable as an archive format for owners of cds and other media who wish to preserve their audio collections if the original media is lost damaged or worn out a flac copy of the audio tracks ensures that an exact duplicate of the original data can be recovered at any time an exact restoration from a lossy archive eg mp of the same data is impossible flac being lossless means it is highly suitable for transcoding eg to mp without the normally associated transcoding quality loss a cue file can optionally be created when ripping a cd if a cd is read and ripped perfectly to flac files the cue file allows later burning of an audio cd that is identical in audio data to the original cd including track order and pregap but excluding cdtext and other additional data such as lyrics and cdg graphics adoption and implementations the reference implementation of flac is implemented as the libflac core encoder  decoder library with the main distributable program codice being the reference implementation of the libflac api this codec api is also available in c as libflac the reference implementation of flac compiles on many platforms including most unix such as solaris bsd and unixlike including linux microsoft windows beos and os operating systems there are build systems for autoconfautomake msvc watcom c and xcode there is currently no multicore support in libflac flac playback support in portable audio devices and dedicated audio systems is limited compared to formats such as mp or uncompressed pcm flac support is included by default in windows  android blackberry  and jolla devices in  several aftermarket mobile electronics companies introduced multimedia solutions that include support for flac these include the nex series from pioneer electronics and the vx and nx from clarion the european broadcasting union ebu has adopted the flac format for the distribution of high quality audio over its euroradio network the windows operating system has supported native flac integration since the introduction of windows  the android operating system has supported native flac playback since version  among others the pono music player and streaming service uses the flac format bandcamp insists on a lossless format for uploading and has flac as a download option since january  gogcom offers video game soundtracks in flac format as bonus the wikimedia foundation sponsored a free and opensource online ecmascript flac tool for browsers supporting the required html features
