javaserver pages javaserver pages jsp is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on html xml or other document types released in  by sun microsystems jsp is similar to php and asp but it uses the java programming language to deploy and run javaserver pages a compatible web server with a servlet container such as apache tomcat or jetty is required overview architecturally jsp may be viewed as a highlevel abstraction of java servlets jsps are translated into servlets at runtime each jsp servlet is cached and reused until the original jsp is modified jsp can be used independently or as the view component of a serverside modelviewcontroller design normally with javabeans as the model and java servlets or a framework such as apache struts as the controller this is a type of model  architecture jsp allows java code and certain predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup content such as html with the resulting page being compiled and executed on the server to deliver a document the compiled pages as well as any dependent java libraries contain java bytecode rather than machine code like any other java program they must be executed within a java virtual machine jvm that interacts with the servers host operating system to provide an abstract platformneutral environment jsps are usually used to deliver html and xml documents but through the use of outputstream they can deliver other types of data as well the web container creates jsp implicit objects like request response session application config page pagecontext out and exception jsp engine creates these objects during translation phase syntax jsp pages use several delimiters for scripting functions the most basic is    which encloses a jsp scriptlet a scriptlet is a fragment of java code that is run when the user requests the page other common delimiters include    for expressions where the scriptlet and delimiters are replaced with the result of evaluating the expression and directives denoted with    java code is not required to be complete or selfcontained within a single scriptlet block it can straddle markup content provided that the page as a whole is syntactically correct for example any java ifforwhile blocks opened in one scriptlet must be correctly closed in a later scriptlet for the page to successfully compile content which falls inside a split block of java code spanning multiple scriptlets is subject to that code content inside an if block will only appear in the output when the if condition evaluates to true likewise content inside a loop construct may appear multiple times in the output depending upon how many times the loop body runs the following would be a valid for loop in a jsp page the output displayed in the users web browser would be expression language version  of the jsp specification added support for the expression language el used to access data and functions in java objects in jsp  it was folded into the unified expression language which is also used in javaserver faces an example of el syntax additional tags the jsp syntax add additional tags called jsp actions to invoke builtin functionality additionally the technology allows for the creation of custom jsp tag libraries that act as extensions to the standard jsp syntax one such library is the jstl with support for common tasks such as iteration and conditionals the equivalent of for and if statements in java compiler a javaserver pages compiler is a program that parses jsps and transforms them into executable java servlets a program of this type is usually embedded into the application server and run automatically the first time a jsp is accessed but pages may also be precompiled for better performance or compiled as a part of the build process to test for errors some jsp containers support configuring how often the container checks jsp file timestamps to see whether the page has changed typically this timestamp would be set to a short interval perhaps seconds during software development and a longer interval perhaps minutes or even never for a deployed web application criticism in  jason hunter author of java servlet programming criticized jsp for either tempting or requiring the programmer to mix java code and html markup although he acknowledged it would wean people off of microsofts active server pages later he added a note to his site saying that jsp had improved since  but also cited its competitors apache velocity and tea template language
