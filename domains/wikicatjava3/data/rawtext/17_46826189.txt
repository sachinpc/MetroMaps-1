sharing google however offered photo storage and organizational tools that surpassed facebooks in power though google lacked the user base to use it by leaving the social network affiliation the photos service changed its association from a sharing platform to a private library platform on february   google announced that the picasa desktop application would be discontinued on march   followed by the closure of the picasa web albums service on may   google stated that the primary reason for retiring picasa was that it wanted to focus its efforts entirely on a single photos service the crossplatform webbased google photos in may  one year after the release of google photos google announced the service had over  million monthly active users other statistics it revealed was at least  petabytes of photosvideos had been uploaded  trillion labels had been applied  billion of those being selfies and  billion animations collages and effects had been created based on the content reception at the may  release of google photos reviewers wrote that the service was among the best of its kind walt mossberg of recode declared the service the best in cloud photo storage against its competition from amazon amazon drive apple icloud dropbox and microsoft onedrive jacob kastrenakes of the verge wrote that the release made google a major competitor in the photo storage market and that its pricing structure obsoleted the idea of paying for photo storage sarah mitroff and lynn la of cnet said the services phone and tablet apps were particularly good the website added that google photos had a more streamlined design than yahoos flickr and more organizing features than apples icloud photo service reviewers praised the services search functions josh lowensohn of the verge noted the services speed and intelligence especially in its ability to sort unorganized photos as well as its photo loading times search speeds and simple photo editing tools fellow verge writer jacob kastrenakes compared the services new image analysis to technology unveiled by flickr earlier in the same month mossberg recode thought the face grouping feature was remarkably accurate but was most impressed by the subjectbased grouping he was surprised that a search for boats found both cape cod fishing boats and venetian gondolas but also noted errors such as a professional photograph registering as a screenshot pc magazine john c dvorak was concerned about the services privacy he was particularly concerned about googles motivation for building the service the companys relationships with existing governments and potential laws that would require google to provide a users entire history of photos upon request dvorak compared such a scenario to inviting others to scrounge through your underwear drawer he criticized the services sync functions and preferred folders of images over an unsorted flat database dvorak also highlighted the services poor choice of photos to animate and lack of longevity guarantees considering the companys abrupt cancellation of google reader he ultimately suggested that users instead use a portable hard drive which he considered safer and less expensive the verge described the services may  release as evidence that google is spinning out the best features of their google social network they considered photos a standout feature of the social network walt mossberg of recode described the release as liberation day for the photos features that were effectively hidden in the widely ignored social network the services strategy the verge said was to put all data on googles services so that it can be accessed universally gorilla tag controversy in june  jacky alcine a yearold african american programmer noticed the new google photos app had filed a number of photos of him and his black friend in an automatically generated album named gorillas after reporting google removed the controversial gorilla
