veracrypt veracrypt is an opensource utility used for onthefly encryption otfe it can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file or encrypt a partition or under microsoft windows except windows  or gpt the entire storage device with preboot authentication veracrypt is a fork of the discontinued truecrypt project it was initially released on june   and has produced its fourteenth release version  as of october   according to its developers security improvements have been implemented and issues raised by the initial truecrypt code audit have been addressed encryption scheme algorithms individual ciphers supported by veracrypt are aes serpent twofish camellia and kuznyechik the magma cipher was removed in version  in response to a security audit additionally five different combinations of cascaded algorithms are available aestwofish aestwofishserpent serpentaes serpenttwofishaes and twofishserpent the cryptographic hash functions available for use in veracrypt are ripemd sha sha streebog and whirlpool modes of operation veracrypt uses the xts mode of operation keys the header key and the secondary header key xts mode are generated using pbkdf with a bit salt and  to  iterations depending on the underlying hash function used security improvements according to its developers veracrypt has made several security improvements over truecrypt while truecrypt uses  iterations of the pbkdfripemd algorithm for system partitions veracrypt uses  iterations for standard containers and other partitions veracrypt uses  iterations of ripemd and  iterations of sha and whirlpool while this makes veracrypt slower at opening encrypted partitions it also makes password guessing based attacks slower a vulnerability in the bootloader was fixed on windows and various optimizations were made as well the developers added support for sha to the system boot encryption option and also fixed a shellexecute security issue linux and mac os x users benefit from support for hard drives with sector sizes larger than  linux also received support for the ntfs formatting of volumes due to the security improvements the veracrypt storage format is incompatible with that of truecrypt the veracrypt development team believes that the old truecrypt format is too vulnerable to an nsa attack and thus it must be abandoned this is one of the main differences between veracrypt and its competitor ciphershed as ciphershed continues to use the truecrypt format however beginning with version f veracrypt is capable of opening and converting volumes in the truecrypt format plausible deniability veracrypt supports a concept called plausible deniability by allowing a single hidden volume to be created within another volume in addition the windows versions of veracrypt has the ability to create and run a hidden encrypted operating system whose existence may be denied the veracrypt documentation lists many ways in which veracrypts hidden volume deniability features may be compromised eg by third party software which may leak information through temporary files thumbnails etc to unencrypted disks and possible ways to avoid this performance veracrypt supports parallelized encryption for multicore systems and under microsoft windows pipelined readwrite operations a form of asynchronous processing to reduce the performance hit of encryption and decryption on newer processors supporting the aesni instruction set veracrypt supports hardwareaccelerated aes to further improve performance the performance impact of disk encryption is especially noticeable on operations which would normally use direct memory access dma as all data must pass through the cpu for decryption rather than being copied directly from disk to ram security concerns veracrypt is vulnerable to various known attacks that also affect other softwarebased disk encryption software such as bitlocker to mitigate these attacks the documentation distributed with veracrypt requires users to follow various security precautions some of these attacks are detailed below encryption keys stored in memory veracrypt stores its keys in the ram on an ordinary personal computer the dram will maintain its contents for several seconds after power is cut or longer if the temperature is lowered even if there is some degradation in the memory contents various algorithms can intelligently recover the keys this method known as a cold boot attack which would apply in particular to a notebook computer obtained while in poweron suspended or screenlocked mode has been successfully used to attack a file system protected by truecrypt physical security veracrypt documentation states that veracrypt is unable to secure data on a computer if an attacker physically accessed it and veracrypt is then used on the compromised computer by the user again this does not affect the common case of a stolen lost or confiscated computer the attacker having physical access to a computer can for example install a hardwaresoftware keylogger a busmastering device capturing memory or install any other malicious hardware or software allowing the attacker to capture unencrypted data including encryption keys and passwords or to decrypt encrypted data using captured passwords or encryption keys therefore physical security is a basic premise of a secure system attacks such as this are often called evil maid attacks malware veracrypt documentation states that veracrypt cannot secure data on a computer if it has any kind of malware installed some kinds of malware are designed to log keystrokes including typed passwords that may then be sent to the attacker over the internet or saved to an unencrypted local drive from which the attacker might be able to read it later when they gain physical access to the computer trusted platform module the faq section of the veracrypt website states that the trusted platform module tpm cannot be relied upon for security because if the attacker has physical or administrative access to the computer and you use it afterwards the computer could have been modified by the attacker eg a malicious componentsuch as a hardware keystroke loggercould have been used to capture the password or other sensitive information since the tpm does not prevent an attacker from maliciously modifying the computer veracrypt will not support tpm security audits an independent code audit of veracrypt  has been conducted by quarkslab on behalf of the open source technology improvement fund the major vulnerabilities identified in this audit were resolved in veracrypt  released the same day veracrypt is based on the source code of truecrypt which passed an independent security audit phase i of the audit was successfully completed on  april  finding no evidence of backdoors or malicious code phase ii of the audit was successfully completed on  april  finding no evidence of deliberate backdoors or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances license and source model veracrypt has been licensed under the apache license  since  june  prior to that it was released under the microsoft public license veracrypt inherited a substantial amount of code from its truecrypt predecessor and thus is also subject to the terms of version  of the truecrypt license which is unique to the truecrypt software it is not one of many widely used open source licenses and is not a free software license according to the free software foundation fsf license list as it contains distribution and copyrightliability restrictions planned features planned features include adding the capability to encrypt gpt system partitions and boot them using uefi this feature uefi boot is available in version a unicode passwords are currently supported on windows for all nonsystem encryption future plans include providing unicode capability throughout veracrypt
