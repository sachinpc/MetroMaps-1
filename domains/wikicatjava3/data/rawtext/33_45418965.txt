openvx openvx is an open royaltyfree standard for cross platform acceleration of computer vision applications it is designed by the khronos group to facilitate portable optimized and powerefficient processing of methods for vision algorithms this is aimed for embedded and realtime programs within computer vision and related scenarios it uses a connected graph representation of operations overview openvx specifies a higher level of abstraction for programming computer vision use cases than compute frameworks such as opencl the high level makes the programming easy and the underlying execution will be efficient on different computing architectures this is done while having a consistent and portable vision acceleration api openvx is based on a connected graph of vision nodes that can execute the preferred chain of operations it is possible to optimize the underlying implementation through various techniques for example acceleration on various processing units or dedicated hardware this architecture facilitate applications programmed in openvx on different systems with different power and performance including batterysensitive visionenabled wearable displays openvx is complementary to the open source vision library opencv opencv is also used for application prototyping however it is not as tightly defined and does not have graph optimizations
