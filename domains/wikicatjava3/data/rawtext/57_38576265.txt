storm event processor apache storm is a distributed stream processing computation framework written predominantly in the clojure programming language originally created by nathan marz and team at backtype the project was open sourced after being acquired by twitter it uses custom created spouts and bolts to define information sources and manipulations to allow batch distributed processing of streaming data the initial release was on  september  a storm application is designed as a topology in the shape of a directed acyclic graph dag with spouts and bolts acting as the graph vertices edges on the graph are named streams and direct data from one node to another together the topology acts as a data transformation pipeline at a superficial level the general topology structure is similar to a mapreduce job with the main difference being that data is processed in real time as opposed to in individual batches additionally storm topologies run indefinitely until killed while a mapreduce job dag must eventually end storm became an apache toplevel project in september  and was previously in incubation since september  development apache storm is developed under the apache license making it available to most companies to use git is used for version control and atlassian jira for issue tracking under the apache incubator program peer platforms storm is but one of dozens of stream processing engines for a more complete list see stream processing twitter announced heron event processor on june   which is api compatible with storm there are other comparable streaming data engines such as spark streaming and flink
