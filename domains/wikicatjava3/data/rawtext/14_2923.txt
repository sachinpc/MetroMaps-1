aol instant messenger aim previously aol instant messenger is an instant messaging and presence computer program which uses the proprietary oscar instant messaging protocol and the toc protocol to allow registered users to communicate in real time aim was popular in the late s and early s in north america and was the leading instant messaging application in that region aims popularity steeply degraded at the end of the decade and its fall has often been compared with other oncepopular internet services such as myspace history aol instant messenger was released by america online aol in may  for microsoft windows the software maintained by aol inc at one time had the largest share of the instant messaging market in north america especially in the united states with  of the total reported  this does not include other instant messaging software related to or developed by aol such as icq and ichat its main competitors during its heyday were icq yahoo messenger and msn messenger aol particularly had a rivalry or chat war with rival microsoft starting in  there were several attempts from microsoft to simultaneously log into their own and aims protocol servers aol were not happy about this and started blocking msn messenger from being able to access aim aim went officially mobile in early  when the application was released for windows mobile devices however aim could already be used on various devices beforehand with thirdparty applications and as early as  on a sidekick since  standalone official aim client software includes advertisements and is available for microsoft windows windows mobile classic mac os macos android ios blackberry os usage decline around  aim started to lose popularity rapidly partly because many people started purely moving onto sms text messaging and social networking websites for instant messaging  one source reported aol instant messenger market share had collapsed to  however this number only reflects installed im applications and not active users the engineers responsible for aim claimed that they were unable to convince aol management that free was the future on march   aol got rid of all the developing staff for aim effectively ending development of the application after  years however the service is still active and help support is still provided the running man the aim mascot was designed by joroan lazaro and was implemented in the first release in  this was a yellow stickmanlike figure often called the running man the mascot appeared on all aim logos and most wordmarks and always appeared at the top of the buddy list aims incredible popularity in the late s and the s led to the running man becoming a familiar brand on the internet after over  years the iconic logo was finally disappeared as part of the aim rebranding in  however in august  the running man once again returned in  an editor of the site complexcom called it a symbol of america in april  the running man was officially featured in the virgin london marathon dressed by a person for the aolpartnered free the children charity protocol the standard protocol that aim clients use to communicate is called open system for communication in realtime oscar most aolproduced versions of aim and popular third party aim clients use this protocol however aol also created a simpler protocol called toc that lacks many of oscars features but is sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality the toctoc protocol specifications were made available by aol while oscar is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverseengineer in january  aol introduced experimental extensible messaging and presence protocol xmpp support for aim allowing aim users to communicate using the standardized opensource xmpp however in march  this service was discontinued as of may  aol offers limited xmpp support privacy for privacy regulations aim has strict age restrictions aim accounts are available only for people over the age of  children younger than that are not permitted access to aim under the aim privacy policy aol has no rights to read or monitor any private communications between users the profile of the user has no privacy if public content is accessed it can be used for online print or even broadcast advertising etc this is outlined in the policy and terms of service  you grant aol its parent affiliates subsidiaries assigns agents and licensees the irrevocable perpetual worldwide right to reproduce display perform distribute adapt and promote this content in any medium this allows anything one posts to be used without a separate request for permission the issue of aims security has been called into question aol states that it has taken great steps to insure that personal information will not be accessed by unauthorized members but that it cannot guarantee that that will not happen aim is different from other clients such as yahoo messenger in that it does not require approval from one buddy to be added to anothers buddy list as a result it is possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they are online read their status and away messages and read their profiles in fact there is a web api to display ones status and away message as a widget on ones web page however one can block another user from communicating and seeing ones status but this does not prevent the user from creating a new account that is not blocked and therefore can still track the first users status a more complete privacy option is to select a menu option allowing communication only with those on ones buddy list this causes blocking thus appearing offline to all users who are not on ones buddy list chat robots aol and various other companies supply robots on aim that can receive messages and send a response based on the bots purpose for example bots can help with studying like studybuddy some are made to relate to children and teenagers like spleak others give advice and others are for more general purposes such as smarterchild the more useful chat bots have features like the ability to play games get sport scores weather forecasts or financial stock information users were able to talk to automated chat bots that could respond to natural human language they were primarily put into place as a marketing strategy and for unique advertising options it was used by advertisers to market products or build better consumer relations before the inclusions of such bots the other bots doormanbot and aimoffline provided features that are provided today by aol for those who needed it zolaonaol and zoeonaol were short lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of smarterchild as of november   the smarterchild bot for aim was retired and is no longer offering any services uri scheme aol instant messengers installation process automatically installs an extra uri scheme protocol handler into some web browsers so uris beginning aim can open a new aim window with specified parameters this is similar in function to the mailto uri scheme which creates a new email message using the systems default mail program for instance a web page might include a link like the following in its html source to open a window for sending a message to the aim user notarealuser to specify a message body the codice parameter is used so the link location might look like this to specify an away message the message parameter is used so the link location might look like this when placing this inside a url link an aim user could click on the url link and the away message hello my name is bill would instantly become their away message to add a buddy the addbuddy message is used with the screenname parameter this type of link is commonly found on forum profiles to easily add contacts vulnerabilities aim has security weaknesses that have enabled exploits to be created that use thirdparty software to perform malicious acts on users computers although most are relatively harmless such as being kicked off the aim service others perform potentially dangerous actions such as sending viruses some of these exploits rely on social engineering to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contain a url accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it an action which leads to infection these messages can easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a web address that installs software on the users computer to restart the cycle users have also reported sudden additions of toolbars and advertisements from third parties in the newer version of aim multiple complaints about the lack of control of third party involvement have caused many users to stop using the service extra features iphone application on march   during apple incs iphone sdk event aol announced that they would be releasing an aim application for iphone and ipod touch users the application is available for free

numbers allowing aim users to receive free incoming calls the service allowed users to make calls to landlines and mobile devices through the use of a computer the service however was only free for receiving and aol charged users  a month for unlimited calling plan in order to use aim phoneline users had to install the latest free version of aim triton software and needed a good set of headphones with a boom microphone it could take several days after a user signed up before it started working the service provided users with many interfaces such as auto action apis ringback tone
