webgl webgl web graphics library is a javascript api for rendering interactive d computer graphics and d graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plugins webgl is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing gpu accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas webgl elements can be mixed with other html elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background webgl programs consist of control code written in javascript and shader code that is executed on a computers graphics processing unit gpu webgl is designed and maintained by the nonprofit khronos group design webgl  is based on opengl es  and provides an api for d graphics it uses the html canvas element and is accessed using document object model interfaces automatic memory management is provided as part of the javascript language like opengl es  webgl does not have the fixedfunction apis introduced in opengl  and deprecated in opengl  this functionality can instead be provided by the user in the javascript code space shaders in webgl are expressed directly in glsl history webgl evolved out of the canvas d experiments started by vladimir vukievi at mozilla vukievi first demonstrated a canvas d prototype in  by the end of  both mozilla and opera had made their own separate implementations in early  the nonprofit technology consortium khronos group started the webgl working group with initial participation from apple google mozilla opera and others version  of the webgl specification was released march  as of march  the chair of the working group is ken russell early applications of webgl include zygote body in november  autodesk announced that they ported most of their applications to the cloud running on local webgl clients these applications included fusion  and autocad  development of the webgl  specification started in  this specification is based on opengl es  support webgl is widely supported in modern browsers however its availability is dependent on other factors like the gpu supporting it the official webgl website offers a simple test page more detailed information like what renderer the browser uses and what extensions are available is provided at thirdparty websites content creation and ecosystem the webgl api may be too tedious to use directly without some utility libraries which for example set up typical view transformation shaders eg for view frustum loading scene graphs and d objects in the popular industry formats is also not directly provided for javascript libraries have been built or sometimes ported to webgl to provide the additional functionality a nonexhaustive list of libraries that provide many highlevel features includes babylonjs threejs od osgjs copperlicht and glge there also has been a rapid emergence of game engines for webgl including unreal engine  and unity  the stagedflashbased awayd highlevel library also has a port to webgl via typescript a more lightweight utility library that provides just the vector and matrix math utilities for shaders is sylvesterjs it is sometimes used in conjunction with a webgl specific extension called glutilsjs although not very common some d libraries like the one used by laid can work with html canvas when webgl is not supported there are also some d libraries built on top of webgl like cocosdx or pixijs which were implemented this way for performance reasons in a move that parallels what happened with the starling framework over staged in the flash world the webglbased d libraries fall back to html canvas when webgl is not available removing the rendering bottleneck by giving almost direct access to the gpu also exposed performance limitations in the javascript implementations some were addressed by asmjs similarly the introduction of staged exposed performance problems within actionscript which were addressed by projects like crossbridge creating content for webgl scenes often means using a regular d content creation tool and exporting the scene to a format that is readable by the viewer or helper library desktop d authoring software such as blender autodesk maya or simlab composer can be used for this purpose particularly blendweb allows a webgl scene to be authored entirely in blender and exported to a browser with a single click even as a standalone web page there are also some webglspecific software such as coppercube and the online webglbased editor claraio online platforms such as sketchfab and claraio allow users to directly upload their d models and display them using a hosted webgl viewer additionally mozilla firefox implemented builtin webgl tools starting with version  that allow editing vertex and fragment shaders a number of other debugging and profiling tools have also emerged xd also made a project called xdom to make xd and vrml content running on webgl the d model will in xml tag codice in html and interactive script will use javascript and dom bs content studio and instantreality xd exporter can exported xd in html and running by webgl notable uses webgl has not only been used in d web design and gaming but also by some researchers for scientific purposes for example in a book named cellular automata the authors have used this technology to simulate debris flow for the article visualization of molecular structures using stateoftheart techniques in webgl tried to simulate molecules with it more basic examples like simulation of the solar system have been made by many developers nasa developed an interactive web application called experience curiosity to celebrate the rd anniversary of the curiosity rover landing on mars this blendwebbased app makes it possible to operate the rover control its cameras and the robotic arm and reproduces some of the prominent events of the mars science laboratory mission the application was presented at the beginning of the webgl section at siggraph  similar technologies for d in a browser java opengl is fairly similar layer to webgl in the java world whereas staged is the equivalent layer in adobe flash player  and later google native client also supports opengl es
