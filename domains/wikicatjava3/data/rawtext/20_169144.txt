lilypond lilypond is a computer program and file format for music engraving one of lilyponds major goals is to produce scores that are engraved with traditional layout rules reflecting the era when scores were engraved by hand lilypond is crossplatform and is available for several common operating systems released under the terms of the gnu general public license lilypond is free software history the lilypond project was started in  by hanwen nienhuys and jan nieuwenhuizen after they decided to abandon work on mpp musixtex preprocessor a project they began collaborating on in  its name was inspired both by the rosegarden project and an acquaintance of nienhuys and nieuwenhuizen named suzanne a name that means lily in hebrew  version  lilypond  was released on july   highlighting the development of a custom music font feta and the complete separation of lilypond from musixtex version  lilypond  was released on september   announcing a simplified syntax model and a much more complete set of facilities for notating various styles of music design lilypond is mostly written in c and uses scheme interpreted by gnu guile as its extension language allowing for user customization it has a relatively large codebase as of march   the source comprises over  lines of c and  lines of scheme and python code it uses a simple text notation for music input which lilypond interprets and processes in a series of stages in the final stage music notation is output to pdf via postscript or other graphical formats such as svg or png lilypond also has the facility to generate midi files that correspond to the music notation output lilypond is a textbased application so it does not contain its own graphical user interface to assist with score creation it does however have a flexible input language that strives to be simple easing the learning curve for new users lilypond adheres to the wysiwym paradigm the workflow for typesetting music notation with lilypond is similar to that of preparing documents with latex lilypond supports experimental musical notation its guitar facilities support alternative tunings such as majorthirds tuning software features lilyponds primary goal is to produce output comparable to professionally engraved scores instead of output that looks mechanical and computergenerated an essay from the lilypond website written by lilypond developers explains some typographical issues addressed by lilypond overview of input syntax the native input language for lilypond is comprehensive consisting of many commands needed for expressing any sort of articulation dynamic meter etc the ability to embed scheme code within a lilypond source file permits arbitrary extensions to the input language and assists with algorithmic composition some general syntactic features are listed below lilyponds interface with pango requires the input character encoding to be utf one benefit of this is that more than one language can be included in the same source file example of lilypond input file more complex output lilypond can also create extensively customised output an example is the short extract of the stockhausen piano piece below collaboration with other projects several graphical scorewriterssuch as rosegarden noteedit canorus denemo and tuxguitarcan export files directly to lilypond format other graphical applications serve as front ends to lilypond including frescobaldi and the lilypondtool plugin for jedit denemo integrates the pdf output of lilypond in its display allowing some editing operations on the final typeset score the mutopia project which distributes free content sheet music uses lilypond to typeset its music as does musipedia a collaborative music encyclopedia emacs orgmode contains support for embedding lilypond scores into documents integration into mediawiki lilypond is available in mediawiki via the code this for example transforms the notation into relative c  f d f a d f e d cis a cis e a g f e  the above excerpt is a simplified version of solfeggio in c minor by cpe bach more complex scores including lyrics are also possible within mediawikis see pastime with good company for an example comparison to other scorewriters finale and sibelius are two proprietary scorewriters often compared to lilypond andrew hawryluk a lilypond user wrote a series of articles comparing output quality between finale and lilypond another scorewriter with comparable features to lilypond is score but score relies on manual positioning more than lilypond does
