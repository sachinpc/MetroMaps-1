linux linux pronounced or less frequently  is a unixlike and mostly posixcompliant computer operating system os assembled under the model of free and opensource software development and distribution the defining component of linux is the linux kernel an operating system kernel first released on september   by linus torvalds the free software foundation uses the name gnulinux to describe the operating system which has led to some controversy linux was originally developed as a free operating system for personal computers based on the intel x architecture but has since been ported to more computer hardware platforms than any other operating system because of the dominance of android on smartphones linux has the largest installed base of all generalpurpose operating systems linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers and virtually all fastest supercomputers but is used on only around  of desktop computers when not including chromeos which has about  of the overall and nearly  of the sub notebook sales linux also runs on embedded systems which are devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system this includes smartphones and tablet computers running android and other linux derivatives tivo and similar dvr devices network routers facility automation controls televisions video game consoles and smartwatches the development of linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and opensource software collaboration the underlying source code may be used modified and distributedcommercially or noncommerciallyby anyone under the terms of its respective licenses such as the gnu general public license typically linux is packaged in a form known as a linux distribution or distro for short for both desktop and server use some of the most popular mainstream linux distributions are arch linux centos debian fedora gentoo linux linux mint mageia opensuse and ubuntu together with commercial distributions such as red hat enterprise linux and suse linux enterprise server distributions include the linux kernel supporting utilities and libraries many of which are provided by the gnu project and usually a large amount of application software to fulfil the distributions intended use distributions oriented toward desktop use typically include a windowing system such as x mir or a wayland implementation and an accompanying desktop environment such as gnome or the kde software compilation some distributions may also include a less resourceintensive desktop such as lxde or xfce distributions intended to run on servers may omit all graphical environments from the standard install and instead include other software to set up and operate a solution stack such as lamp because linux is freely redistributable anyone may create a distribution for any intended use history antecedents the unix operating system was conceived and implemented in  at atts bell laboratories in the united states by ken thompson dennis ritchie douglas mcilroy and joe ossanna first released in  unix was written entirely in assembly language as it was common practice at the time later in a key pioneering approach in  it was rewritten in the c programming language by dennis ritchie with exceptions to the kernel and io the availability of a highlevel language implementation of unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business att was required to license the operating systems source code to anyone who asked as a result unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses in  att divested itself of bell labs freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing bell labs began selling unix as a proprietary product the gnu project started in  by richard stallman has the goal of creating a complete unixcompatible software system composed entirely of free software work began in  later in  stallman started the free software foundation and wrote the gnu general public license gnu gpl in  by the early s many of the programs required in an operating system such as libraries compilers text editors a unix shell and a windowing system were completed although lowlevel elements such as device drivers daemons and the kernel were stalled and incomplete linus torvalds has stated that if the gnu kernel had been available at the time  he would not have decided to write his own although not released until  due to legal complications development of bsd from which netbsd openbsd and freebsd descended predated that of linux torvalds has also stated that if bsd had been available at the time he probably would not have created linux minix was created by andrew s tanenbaum a computer science professor and released in  as a minimal unixlike operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn the operating system principles although the complete source code of minix was freely available the licensing terms prevented it from being free software until the licensing changed in april  creation in  while attending the university of helsinki torvalds became curious about operating systems and frustrated by the licensing of minix which at the time limited it to educational use only he began to work on his own operating system kernel which eventually became the linux kernel torvalds began the development of the linux kernel on minix and applications written for minix were also used on linux later linux matured and further linux kernel development took place on linux systems gnu applications also replaced all minix components because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the gnu project with the fledgling operating system code licensed under the gnu gpl can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license torvalds initiated a switch from his original license which prohibited commercial redistribution to the gnu gpl developers worked to integrate gnu components with the linux kernel making a fully functional and free operating system naming linus torvalds had wanted to call his invention freax a portmanteau of free freak and x as an allusion to unix during the start of his work on the system some of the projects makefiles included the name freax for about half a year torvalds had already considered the name linux but initially dismissed it as too egotistical in order to facilitate development the files were uploaded to the ftp server ftpfunetfi of funet in september  ari lemmke torvalds coworker at the helsinki university of technology hut who was one of the volunteer administrators for the ftp server at the time did not think that freax was a good name so he named the project linux on the server without consulting torvalds later however torvalds consented to linux to demonstrate how the word linux should be pronounced   torvalds included an audio guide  with the kernel source code another variant of pronunciation is  commercial and popular uptake adoption of linux in production environments rather than being used only by hobbyists started to take off first in the mids in the supercomputing community where organizations such as nasa started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running linux commercial use followed when dell and ibm followed by hewlettpackard started offering linux support to escape microsofts monopoly in the desktop operating system market today linux systems are used throughout computing from embedded systems to supercomputers and have secured a place in server installations such as the popular lamp application stack use of linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market with many devices shipping with customized linux distributions installed and google releasing their own chromeos designed for netbooks linuxs greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market with android being one of the most dominant operating systems on smartphones and very popular on tablets and more recently on wearables linux gaming is also on the rise with valve showing its support for linux and rolling out its own gaming oriented linux distribution linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments such as the federal government of brazil current development torvalds continues to direct the development of the kernel stallman heads the free software foundation which in turn supports the gnu components finally individuals and corporations develop thirdparty nongnu components these thirdparty components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel gnu components and nongnu components with additional package management software in the form of linux distributions design a linuxbased system is a modular unixlike operating system deriving much of its basic design from principles established in unix during the s and s such a system uses a monolithic kernel the linux kernel which handles process control networking access to the peripherals and file systems device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules that are loaded while the system is running separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the systems higherlevel functionality the gnu userland is an important part of most linuxbased systems providing the most common implementation of the c library a popular cli shell and many of the common unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks the graphical user interface or gui used by most linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the x window system more recently the linux community seeks to advance to wayland as the new display server protocol in place of x ubuntu however develops mir instead of wayland installed components of a linux system include the following user interface the user interface also known as the shell is either a commandline interface cli a graphical user interface gui or through controls attached to the associated hardware which is common for embedded systems for desktop systems the default mode is usually a graphical user interface although the cli is available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console cli shells are textbased user interfaces which use text for both input and output the dominant shell used in linux is the bourneagain shell bash originally developed for the gnu project most lowlevel linux components including various parts of the userland use the cli exclusively the cli is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks and provides very simple interprocess communication on desktop systems the most popular user interfaces are the gui shells packaged together with extensive desktop environments such as the k desktop environment kde gnome mate cinnamon unity lxde pantheon and xfce though a variety of additional user interfaces exist most popular user interfaces are based on the x window system often simply called x it provides network transparency and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application however certain extensions of the x window system are not capable of working over the network several x display servers exist with the reference implementation xorg server being the most popular several types of window managers exist for x including tiling dynamic stacking and compositing window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows and interact with the x window system simpler x window managers such as dwm or ratpoison provide a minimalist functionality while more elaborate window managers such as fvwm enlightenment or window maker provide more features such as a builtin taskbar and themes but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations such as mutter gnome kwin kde or xfwm xfce although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred wayland is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the x protocol  it has not received wider adoption unlike x wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager therefore a wayland compositor takes the role of the display server window manager and compositing manager weston is the reference implementation of wayland while gnomes mutter and kdes kwin are being ported to wayland as standalone display servers enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version  video input infrastructure linux currently has two modern kerneluserspace apis for handing video input devices vl api for video streams and radio and dvb api for digital tv reception due to the complexity and diversity of different devices and due to the large amount of formats and standards handled by those apis this infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices also a good userspace device library is the key of the success for having userspace applications to be able to work with all formats supported by those devices development the primary difference between linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the linux kernel and other components are free and opensource software linux is not the only such operating system although it is by far the most widely used some free and opensource software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft a kind of reciprocity any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself the most common free software license the gnu general public license gpl is a form of copyleft and is used for the linux kernel and many of the components from the gnu project linux based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards linux systems adhere to posix sus lsb iso and ansi standards where possible although to date only one linux distribution has been posix certified linuxft free software projects although developed through collaboration are often produced independently of each other the fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution however provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by standalone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a linux distribution many linux distributions or distros manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection this allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs distributions are maintained by individuals looseknit teams volunteer organizations and commercial entities a distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed linux kernel general system security and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole distributions typically use a package manager such as apt yum zypper pacman or portage to install remove and update all of a systems software from one central location community a distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis debian being a wellknown example others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions as red hat does with fedora and suse does with opensuse in many cities and regions local associations known as linux user groups lugs seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software they hold meetings and provide free demonstrations training technical support and operating system installation to new users many internet communities also provide support to linux users and developers most distributions and free software  opensource projects have irc chatrooms or newsgroups online forums are another means for support with notable examples being linuxquestionsorg and the various distribution specific support and community forums such as ones for ubuntu fedora and gentoo linux distributions host mailing lists commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list there are several technology websites with a linux focus print magazines on linux often bundle cover disks that carry software or even complete linux distributions although linux distributions are generally available without charge several large corporations sell support and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of free software an analysis of the linux kernel showed  percent of the code from december  to january  was developed by programmers working for corporations leaving about  percent to volunteers and  unclassified major corporations that provide contributions include dell ibm hp oracle sun microsystems now part of oracle and nokia a number of corporations notably red hat canonical and suse have built a significant business around linux distributions the free software licenses on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the linux kernel are based explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization the relationship between a linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as symbiotic one common business model of commercial suppliers is charging for support especially for business users a number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks another business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware this used to be the norm in the computer industry with operating systems such as cpm apple dos and versions of mac os prior to  freely copyable but not modifiable as computer hardware standardized throughout the s it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic as the os would run on any manufacturers computer that shared the same architecture programming on linux linux distributions support dozens of programming languages the original development tools used for building both linux applications and operating system programs are found within the gnu toolchain which includes the gnu compiler collection gcc and the gnu build system amongst others gcc provides compilers for ada c c go and fortran many programming languages have a crossplatform reference implementation that supports linux for example php perl ruby python java go rust and haskell first released in  the llvm project provides an alternative crossplatform opensource compiler for many languages proprietary compilers for linux include the intel c compiler sun studio and ibm xl cc compiler basic in the form of visual basic is supported in such forms as gambas freebasic and xbasic and in terms of terminal programming or quickbasic or turbo basic programming in the form of qb a common feature of unixlike systems linux includes traditional specificpurpose programming languages targeted at scripting text processing and system configuration and management in general linux distributions support shell scripts awk sed and make many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves for example regular expressions are supported in programs like grep or locate while advanced text editors like gnu emacs have a complete lisp interpreter builtin most distributions also include support for php perl ruby python and other dynamic languages while not as common linux also supports c via mono vala and scheme a number of java virtual machines and development kits run on linux including the original sun microsystems jvm hotspot and ibms jse re as well as many opensource projects like kaffe and jikesrvm gnome and kde are popular desktop environments and provide a framework for developing applications these projects are based on the gtk and qt widget toolkits respectively which can also be used independently of the larger framework both support a wide variety of languages there are a number of integrated development environments available including anjuta  codelite eclipse geany activestate komodo kdevelop lazarus monodevelop netbeans and qt creator while the longestablished editors vim nano and emacs remain popular hardware support the linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers it runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures including the handheld armbased ipaq and the ibm mainframes system z or system z specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures for example the elks kernel fork can run on intel  or intel  bit microprocessors while the clinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit the kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturercreated operating system such as macintosh computers with both powerpc and intel processors pdas video game consoles portable music players and mobile phones there are several industry associations and hardware conferences devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under linux such as freedomhec over time support for different hardware has improved in linux resulting in any offtheshelf purchase having a good chance of being compatible uses beside the linux distributions designed for generalpurpose use on desktops and servers distributions may be specialized for different purposes including computer architecture support embedded systems stability security localization to a specific region or language targeting of specific user groups support for realtime applications or commitment to a given desktop environment furthermore some distributions deliberately include only free software  over four hundred linux distributions are actively developed with about a dozen distributions being most popular for generalpurpose use desktop the popularity of linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years most modern distributions include a graphical user environment with  the two most popular environments being the kde plasma desktop and xfce no single official linux desktop exists rather desktop environments and linux distributions select components from a pool of free and opensource software with which they construct a gui implementing some more or less strict design guide gnome for example has its human interface guidelines as a design guide which gives the humanmachine interface an important role not just when doing the graphical design but also when considering people with disabilities and even when focusing on security the collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform language localization of some linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be costeffective for example the sinhalese language version of the knoppix distribution became available significantly before microsoft translated windows xp into sinhalese in this case the lanka linux user group played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors linguists and local developers performance and applications the performance of linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic for example in  con kolivas accused the linux community of favoring performance on servers he quit linux kernel development out of frustration with this lack of focus on the desktop and then gave a tell all interview on the topic since then a significant amount of development has focused on improving the desktop experience projects such as upstart and systemd aim for a faster boot time the wayland and mir projects aim at replacing x while enhancing desktop performance security and appearance many popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems for example mozilla firefox openofficeorglibreoffice and blender have downloadable versions for all major operating systems furthermore some applications initially developed for linux such as pidgin and gimp were ported to other operating systems including windows and mac os x due to their popularity in addition a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on linux such as autodesk maya softimage xsi and apple shake in the highend field of animation and visual effects see the list of proprietary software for linux for more details there are also several companies that have ported their own or other companies games to linux with linux also being a supported platform on both the popular steam and desura digitaldistribution services many other types of applications available for microsoft windows and mac os x also run on linux commonly either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system or that application will have a version that works on linux such as with skype and some video games like dota  and team fortress  furthermore the wine project provides a windows compatibility layer to run unmodified windows applications on linux it is sponsored by commercial interests including codeweavers which produces a commercial version of the software since  google has also provided funding to the wine project crossover a proprietary solution based on the opensource wine project supports running windows versions of microsoft office intuit applications such as quicken and quickbooks adobe photoshop versions through cs and many popular games such as world of warcraft in other cases where there is no linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing and professional audio there is equivalent software available on linux components and installation besides externally visible components such as x window managers a nonobvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by freedesktoporg such as dbus or pulseaudio both major desktop environments gnome and kde include them each offering graphical frontends written using the corresponding toolkit gtk or qt a display server is another component which for the longest time has been communicating in the x display server protocol with its clients prominent software talking x includes the xorg server and xlib frustration over the cumbersome x core protocol and especially over its numerous extensions has led to the creation of a new display server protocol wayland installing updating and removing software in linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the synaptic package manager packagekit and yum extender while most major linux distributions have extensive repositories often containing tens of thousands of packages not all the software that can run on linux is available from the official repositories alternatively users can install packages from unofficial repositories download precompiled packages directly from websites or compile the source code by themselves all these methods come with different degrees of difficulty compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new linux users but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to linux netbooks linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market with many devices such as the asus eee pc and acer aspire one shipping with customized linux distributions installed in  google announced its chromeos as a minimal linuxbased operating system using the chrome browser as the main user interface chromeos does not run any nonweb applications except for the bundled file manager and media player a certain level of support for android applications was added in later versions the netbooks that shipped with the operating system termed chromebooks started appearing on the market in june  servers mainframes and supercomputers linux distributions have long been used as server operating systems and have risen to prominence in that area netcraft reported in september  that eight of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran linux distributions on their web servers in june  linux distributions represented five of the top ten freebsd three of ten and microsoft two of ten since february  linux distributions represented six of the top ten freebsd two of ten and microsoft one of ten linux distributions are the cornerstone of the lamp serversoftware combination linux apache mariadbmysql perlphppython which has achieved popularity among developers and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting linux distributions have become increasingly popular on mainframes partly due to pricing and the opensource model in december  computer giant ibm reported that it would predominantly market and sell mainframebased enterprise linux server at linuxcon north america  ibm announced linuxone a series of mainframes specifically designed to run linux and opensource software linux distributions are also most commonly used as operating systems for supercomputers in the decade since the earth simulator supercomputer all the fastest supercomputers have used linux    of performance share of the worlds  fastest supercomputers run some variant of linux including the top  smart devices several operating systems for smart devices such as smartphones tablet computers smart tvs and invehicle infotainment ivi systems are based on linux major platforms for such systems include android firefoxos mer and tizen android has become the dominant mobile operating system for smartphones running on  of units sold worldwide during the second quarter of  android is also a popular operating system for tablets and android smart tvs and invehicle infotainment systems have also appeared in the market cellphones and pdas running linux on opensource platforms became more common from  examples include the nokia n openmokos neo and the motorola rokr e continuing the trend palm later acquired by hp produced a new linuxderived operating system webos which is built into its line of palm pre smartphones nokias maemo one of the earliest mobile operating systems was based on debian it was later merged with intels moblin another linuxbased operating system to form meego the project was later terminated in favor of tizen an operating system targeted at mobile devices as well as ivi tizen is a project within the linux foundation several samsung products are already running tizen samsung gear  being the most significant example samsung z smartphones will use tizen instead of android as a result of meegos termination the mer project forked the meego codebase to create a basis for mobileoriented operating systems in july  jolla announced sailfish os their own mobile operating system built upon mer technology mozillas firefoxos consists of the linux kernel a hardware abstraction layer a webstandardsbased runtime environment and user interface and an integrated web browser canonical has released ubuntu touch aiming to bring convergence to the user experience on this mobile operating system and its desktop counterpart ubuntu the operating system also provides a full ubuntu desktop when connected to an external monitor embedded devices due to its low cost and ease of customization linux is often used in embedded systems in the nonmobile telecommunications equipment sector the majority of customerpremises equipment cpe hardware runs some linuxbased operating system openwrt is a community driven example upon which many of the oem firmwares are based for example the popular tivo digital video recorder also uses a customized linux as do several network firewalls and routers from such makers as ciscolinksys the korg oasys the korg kronos the yamaha motif xsmotif xf music workstations yamaha sxssxs yamaha moxmox synthesizers yamaha motifrack xs tone generator module and roland rdgx digital piano also run linux linux is also used in stage lighting control systems such as the wholehogiii console gaming there had been several games that run on traditional desktop linux and many of which originally written for desktop os however due to most game developers not paying attention to such a small market as desktop linux only a few prominent games have been available for desktop linux on the other hand as a popular mobile platform android has gained much developer interest and there are many games available for android on february   valve released a linux version of steam a popular game distribution platform on pc many steam games were ported to linux on december   valve released steamos a gaming oriented os based on debian for beta testing and has plans to ship steam machines as a gaming and entertainment platform valve has also developed vogl an opengl debugger intended to aid video game development as well as porting its source game engine to desktop linux as a result of valves effort several prominent games such as dota  team fortress  portal portal  and left  dead  are now natively available on desktop linux on july   nvidia released shield as an attempt to use android as a specialized gaming platform specialized uses due to the flexibility customizability and free and opensource nature of linux it becomes possible to highly tune linux for a specific purpose there are two main methods for creating a specialized linux distribution building from scratch or from a generalpurpose distribution as a base the distributions often used for this purpose include debian fedora ubuntu which is itself based on debian arch linux gentoo and slackware in contrast linux distributions built from scratch do not have generalpurpose bases instead they focus on the jeos philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding resource overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distributions use cases home theater pc a home theater pc htpc is a pc that is mainly used as an entertainment system especially a home theater system it is normally connected to a television and often an additional audio system openelec a linux distribution that incorporates the media center software kodi is an os tuned specifically for an htpc having been built from the ground up adhering to the jeos principle the os is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an htpc there are also special editions of linux distributions that include the mythtv media center software such as mythbuntu a special edition of ubuntu digital security kali linux is a debianbased linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing it comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying security exploits the ubuntu derivative backbox provides preinstalled security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking there are many linux distributions created with privacy secrecy network anonymity and information security in mind including tails tin hat linux and tinfoil hat linux lightweight portable security is a distribution based on arch linux and developed by the united states department of defense torramdisk is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software tor system rescue linux live cd sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system building upon that idea several linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged most of which use gparted as a partition editor with additional data recovery and system repair software in space spacex uses multiple redundant s in a faulttolerant design in the falcon rocket each merlin engine is controlled by three voting computers with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each others operation linux is not inherently faulttolerant no operating system is as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose for flexibility commercial offtheshelf parts and systemwide radiationtolerant design are used instead of radiation hardened parts  spacex has made  launches of the falcon since  out of which  have successfully delivered their primary payloads to earth orbit including some support missions for the international space station in addition windows was used as an operating system on nonmission critical systemslaptops used on board the space station for examplebut it has been replaced with linux the first linuxpowered humanoid robot is also undergoing inflight testing the jet propulsion laboratory has used linux for a number of years to help with projects relating to the construction of unmanned space flight and deep space exploration nasa uses linux in robotics in the mars rover and ubuntu linux to save data from satellites education linux distributions have been created to provide handson experience with coding and source code to students on devices such as the raspberry pi in addition to producing a practical device the intention is to show students how things work under the hood the ubuntu derivatives edubuntu and the linux schools project as well as the debian derivative skolelinux provide educationoriented software packages they also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computerbased classrooms such as the linux terminal server project ltsp others instant webkiosk and webconverger are browserbased linux distributions often used in web kiosks and digital signage thinstation is a minimalist distribution designed for thin clients rocks cluster distribution is tailored for highperformance computing clusters there are generalpurpose linux distributions that target a specific audience such as users of a specific language or geographical area such examples include ubuntu kylin for chinese language users and blankon targeted at indonesians professionspecific distributions include ubuntu studio for media creation and dnalinux for bioinformatics there is also a muslimoriented distribution of the name sabily as well as an arabicfocused distribution called ojuba linux that consequently also provides some islamic tools certain organizations use slightly specialized linux distributions internally including gendbuntu used by the french national gendarmerie goobuntu used internally by google and astra linux developed specifically for the russian army market share and uptake many quantitative studies of freeopensource software focus on topics including market share and reliability with numerous studies specifically examining linux the linux market is growing rapidly and the revenue of servers desktops and packaged software running linux was expected to exceed  billion by  analysts and proponents attribute the relative success of linux to its security reliability low cost and freedom from vendor lockin copyright trademark and naming linux kernel is licensed under the gnu general public license gpl version  the gpl requires that anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license must make the originating source code and any modifications available to the recipient under the same terms other key components of a typical linux distribution are also mainly licensed under the gpl but they may use other licenses many libraries use the gnu lesser general public license lgpl a more permissive variant of the gpl and the xorg implementation of the x window system uses the mit license torvalds states that the linux kernel will not move from version  of the gpl to version  he specifically dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in digital rights management it would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders who number in the thousands a  study of red hat linux  found that this distribution contained  million source lines of code using the constructive cost model the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand manyears of development time according to the study if all this software had been developed by conventional proprietary means it would have cost about   us dollars to develop in the united states most of the source code  was written in the c programming language but many other languages were used including c lisp assembly language perl python fortran and various shell scripting languages slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the gpl the linux kernel itself was  million lines of code or  of the total in a later study the same analysis was performed for debian version  etch which was released in  this distribution contained close to  million source lines of code and the study estimated that it would have required about seventy three thousand manyears and cost us in dollars to develop by conventional means in the united states the name linux is a trademark registered to linus torvalds initially nobody registered it but on august   william r della croce jr filed for the trademark linux and then demanded royalties from linux distributors in  torvalds and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned to torvalds and in  the case was settled the licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the linux mark institute lmi torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it lmi originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the linux name as part of trademarks but later changed this in favor of offering a free perpetual worldwide sublicense the free software foundation fsf prefers gnulinux as the name when referring to the operating system as a whole because it considers linux distributions to be variants of the gnu operating system initiated in  by richard stallman president of the fsf a minority of public figures and software projects other than stallman and the fsf notably debian which had been sponsored by the fsf up to  also use gnulinux when referring to the operating system as a whole most media and common usage however refers to this family of operating systems simply as linux as do many large linux distributions for example suse linux and red hat enterprise linux  about  to  of a modern linux distribution is made of gnu components the range depending on whether gnome is considered part of gnu as determined by counting lines of source code making up ubuntus natty release meanwhile about  is taken by the linux kernel
