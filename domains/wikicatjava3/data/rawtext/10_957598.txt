linda coordination language in computer science linda is a model of coordination and communication among several parallel processes operating upon objects stored in and retrieved from shared virtual associative memory it was developed by david gelernter and nicholas carriero at yale university model this model is implemented as a coordination language in which several primitives operating on ordered sequence of typed data objects tuples are added to a sequential language such as c and a logically global associative memory called a tuplespace in which processes store and retrieve tuples the original linda model requires four operations that individual workers perform on the tuples and the tuplespace evaluation compared to other parallelprocessing models linda is more orthogonal in treating process coordination as a separate activity from computation and it is more general in being able to subsume various levels of concurrencyuniprocessor multithreaded multiprocessor or networkedunder a single model its orthogonality allows processes computing in different languages and platforms to interoperate using the same primitives its generality allows a multithreaded linda system to be distributed across multiple computers without change whereas messagepassing models require tightlycoupled processes sending messages to each other in some sequence or protocol linda processes are decoupled from other processes communicating only through the tuplespace a process need have no notion of other processes except for the kinds of tuples consumed or produced data coupling researchers have proposed more primitives to support different types of communication and coordination between open distributed computer systems and to solve particular problems arising from various uses of the model researchers have also experimented with various means of implementing the virtual shared memory for this model many of these researchers proposed larger modifications to the original linda model developing a family of systems known as lindalike systems and implemented as orthogonal technology unlike original version an example of this is the language ease designed by steven ericssonzenith implementations linda was originally implemented in c and fortran but has since been implemented in many programming languages including some of the more notable linda implementations include criticisms criticisms of linda from the multiprocessing community tend to focus on the decreased speed of operations in linda systems as compared to message passing interface mpi systems while not without justification these claims were largely refuted for an important class of problems detailed criticisms of the linda model can also be found in steven ericssonzeniths book process interaction models name linda is named after linda lovelace an actress in the pornographic film deep throat a pun on adas tribute to ada lovelace
