ogre objectoriented graphics rendering engine ogre is a sceneoriented realtime d rendering engine as opposed to a game engine ogre is crossplatform and abstracts from the underlying system libraries like directd and opengl architecture and features ogres main purpose is to provide graphics rendering while it also comes with other facilities vector and matrix classes memory handling etc they are considered supplemental it doesnt provide audio or physics support for instance ogre is written in c and has an objectoriented design with a plugin architecture that allows addition of features thus making it highly modular ogre explicitly supports the ois sdl and cegui libraries and includes the cg toolkit the libraries also feature memory debugging and loading resources from archives rendering engine features ogre is a scene graph based engine with support for a wide variety of scene managers most notably octree binary space partitioning bsp and a paging landscape scene manager along with a betastage portalbased scene manager under ongoing development the landscape scene manager has support for progressive level of detail lod which can be created automatically or manually the animation engine has full support for hardware weighted multiple bone skinning which can be fixed across several poses for full pose mixing ogre is designed to make it easier to write programs that use hardwareaccelerated d graphics ogre also supports vertex and fragment programs along with custom shaders written in opengl shading language glsl highlevel shading language hlsl cg and assembly language ogre also has a compositing manager with a scripting language and full screen video postprocessing for effects such as high dynamic range rendering hdr blooming saturation brightness blurring and noise a particle system with extensible rendering and customizable effectors and emitters language bindings and wrappers there exist a number of ogre bindings to other languages and frameworks including perl purebasic pythonogre for python ogrerb for ruby ogrej for java and ogredotnet gmogre for  mogre for net and hogre for haskell export formats there are content exporter tools available for most d modelers around including d studio max maya blender lightwave milkshape sketchup and more supported platforms ogre has crossplatform support as the class library abstracts from the underlying system libraries like directd and opengl it renders the same content on different platforms without the content creator having to take into consideration the different capabilities of each platform  it supports linux windows all major versions os x google native client nacl winrt windows phone  ios and android currently precompiled binaries exist for linux os x and all major versions of windows an unofficial freebsd port is maintained by the freebsd community history ogres history goes back to end  and begin of  when the project was registered on sourceforge ogre was initalliy published under a dual license one being gnu lesser general public license lgpl the other one called ogre unrestricted license oul to make it possible to be chosen for console development as well because most of the publishers wont use the copyleft license terms version naming ogres development is organized in version branches these branches have been named after members of an ancient race of fearsome deities called the great old ones in the cthulhu mythology of h p lovecraft hastur for x azathoth for x dagon for x and x eihort for x and x shoggoth for x and x release  ogres version  azathoth was released in february  google summer of code  ogre got  slots in google summer of code  to enhance the existing engine and add new features to it these entries were a tool for onestep solution for artists rmogreexporter v fxogreexporter instancing crowd rendering extending demoing and documenting the shadow mapping system scene management and billboard clouds in the following years many other google summer of code projects have been realized for the ogre engine relicensing in  with version  ogre was relicensed under the terms of the permissive mit license a simpler license text was given as reason as of  ogre has crossplatform support the current release in the xy series is  ghadamon released on november   release history a brief history of ogre and its milestones reception ogre has an active community and was sourceforges project of the month in march  it has been used in some commercial games such as ankh torchlight and garshasp
