netbeans netbeans is a software development platform written in java the netbeans platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules applications based on the netbeans platform including the netbeans integrated development environment ide can be extended by third party developers the netbeans ide is primarily intended for development in java but also supports other languages in particular php cc and html netbeans is crossplatform and runs on microsoft windows mac os x linux solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible jvm the netbeans team actively support the product and seek feature suggestions from the wider community every release is preceded by a time for community testing and feedback history netbeans began in  as xelfi word play on delphi a java ide student project under the guidance of the faculty of mathematics and physics at charles university in prague in  roman stank formed a company around the project and produced commercial versions of the netbeans ide until it was bought by sun microsystems in  sun opensourced the netbeans ide in june of the following year since then the netbeans community has continued to grow in  sun and thus netbeans was acquired by oracle corporation under oracle netbeans competed with jdeveloper a freeware ide that has historically been a product of the company in september  oracle submitted a proposal to donate the netbeans project to the apache software foundation stating that it was opening up the netbeans governance model to give netbeans constituents a greater voice in the projects direction and future success through the upcoming release of java  and netbeans  and beyond the move which was endorsed by java creator james gosling netbeans ide  introduced support for developing ide modules and rich client applications based on the netbeans platform a java swing gui builder formerly known as project matisse improved cvs support weblogic  and jboss  support and many editor enhancements netbeans  is available in official repositories of major linux distributions netbeans ide  released in november  extended the existing java ee features including java persistence support ejb  and jaxws additionally the netbeans enterprise pack supports the development of java ee  enterprise applications including soa visual design tools xml schema tools web services orchestration for bpel and uml modeling the netbeans ide bundle for cc supports cc and fortran development netbeans ide  is the first ide to provide complete support of java ee  and the glassfish enterprise server v developers hosting their opensource projects on kenaicom additionally benefit from instant messaging and issue tracking integration and navigation right in the ide support for web application development with php  and the symfony framework and improved code completion layouts hints and navigation in javafx projects netbeans ide  released in june  added support for osgi spring framework  java ee dependency injection jsr zend framework for php and easier code navigation such as is overriddenimplemented annotations formatting hints and refactoring across several languages netbeans ide  was released in april  on august   the netbeans team released netbeans ide  which has full support for the official release of the java se  platform netbeans ide  was released in february  which added support for html and web technologies netbeans ide  was released on october   netbeans ide  was released on march   netbeans ide  was released on november   netbeans ide  was released on october   netbeans has a roadmap document for release plans netbeans platform the netbeans platform is a framework for simplifying the development of java swing desktop applications the netbeans ide bundle for java se contains what is needed to start developing netbeans plugins and netbeans platform based applications no additional sdk is required applications can install modules dynamically any application can include the update center module to allow users of the application to download digitally signed upgrades and new features directly into the running application reinstalling an upgrade or a new release does not force users to download the entire application again the platform offers reusable services common to desktop applications allowing developers to focus on the logic specific to their application among the features of the platform are a showcase of applications developed on top of netbeans platform is available at httpsnetbeansorgfeaturesplatformshowcasehtml netbeans ide netbeans ide is an opensource integrated development environment netbeans ide supports development of all java application types java se including javafx java me web ejb and mobile applications out of the box among other features are an antbased project system maven support refactorings version control supporting cvs subversion git mercurial and clearcase modularity all the functions of the ide are provided by modules each module provides a welldefined function such as support for the java language editing or support for the cvs versioning system and svn netbeans contains all the modules needed for java development in a single download allowing the user to start working immediately modules also allow netbeans to be extended new features such as support for other programming languages can be added by installing additional modules for instance sun studio sun java studio enterprise and sun java studio creator from sun microsystems are all based on the netbeans ide license from july  through  netbeans ide was licensed under suns common development and distribution license cddl a license based on the mozilla public license mpl in october  sun announced that netbeans would henceforth be offered under a dual license of the cddl and the gpl version  licenses with the gpl linking exception for gnu classpath other products in an october  interview with gabriela motroc oracle vice president bill pataky stated that oracle has a number of products that depend on netbeans integrated modules these modules are part of the netbeans ide netbeans profiler the netbeans profiler is a tool for the monitoring of java applications it helps developers find memory leaks and optimize speed formerly downloaded separately it is integrated into the core ide since version  the profiler is based on a sun laboratories research project that was named jfluid that research uncovered specific techniques that can be used to lower the overhead of profiling a java application one of those techniques is dynamic bytecode instrumentation which is particularly useful for profiling large java applications using dynamic bytecode instrumentation and additional algorithms the netbeans profiler is able to obtain runtime information on applications that are too large or complex for other profilers netbeans also support profiling points that let you profile precise points of execution and measure execution time gui design tool formerly known as project matisse the gui designtool enables developers to prototype and design swing guis by dragging and positioning gui components the gui builder has builtin support for jsr  beans binding technology but the support for jsr  swing application framework was removed in  netbeans javascript editor the netbeans javascript editor provides extended support for javascript ajax and css javascript editor features comprise syntax highlighting refactoring code completion for native objects and functions generation of javascript class skeletons generation of ajax callbacks from a template and automatic browser compatibility checks css editor features comprise code completion for styles names quick navigation through the navigator panel displaying the css rule declaration in a list view and file structure in a tree view sorting the outline view by name type or declaration order list  tree creating rule declarations tree only refactoring a part of a rule name tree only the netbeans  and later uses the new nashorn javascript engine developed by oracle netbeans ide download bundles users can choose to download netbeans ide bundles tailored to specific development needs users can also download and install all other features at a later date directly through the netbeans ide netbeans ide bundle for web and java ee the netbeans ide bundle for web  java ee provides complete tools for all the latest java ee  standards including the new java ee  web profile enterprise java beans ejbs servlets java persistence api web services and annotations netbeans also supports the jsf  facelets javaserver pages jsp hibernate spring and struts frameworks and the java ee  and jee  platforms it includes glassfish and apache tomcat some of its features with javaee includes netbeans ide bundle for php netbeans supports php since version  the bundle for php includes netbeans ide complete bundle oracle also releases a version of netbeans that includes all of the features of the above bundles this bundle includes official ruby support was removed with the release of  localization netbeans ide is translated into the following languages community translations of the ide are also available in the following languages
