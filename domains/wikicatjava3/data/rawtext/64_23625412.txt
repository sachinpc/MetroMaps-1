jsr  jsr  is a java specification request with the objective to develop annotations that is information about a software program that is not part of the program itself for common semantic concepts in the java se and java ee platforms that apply across a variety of individual technologies it was envisioned that various jsrs would use annotations to enable a declarative style of programming it would be especially valuable to have consistency within the java ee component jsrs but it is also valuable to allow consistency between java ee and java se description and purpose jsr  as a java specification request has the objective to define a set of annotations that address common semantic concepts and therefore can be used by many java ee and java se components this is to avoid redundant annotations across those components jsr  was released on  may  as declarative annotationdriven configuration is more and more used in java frameworks and applications eg spring makes more components of its framework configurable via annotations the importance of jsr  is likely to increase in the future dependencies to other jsrs jsr  depends on jsr  and therefore also on java se  implementation all nonjava ee jsr  annotations were added to the java se with version  generated postconstruct predestroy resource resources they are located in the package
