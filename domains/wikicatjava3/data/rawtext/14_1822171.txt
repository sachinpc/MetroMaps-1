fortress programming language fortress is a discontinued experimental programming language for highperformance computing created by sun microsystems with funding from darpas high productivity computing systems project one of the language designers was guy l steele jr whose previous work includes scheme common lisp and java design the name fortress was intended to connote a secure fortran ie a language for highperformance computation that provides abstraction and type safety on par with modern programming language principles language features included implicit parallelism unicode support and concrete syntax similar to mathematical notation the language was not designed to be similar to fortran syntactically it most resembles scala standard ml and haskell fortress was designed from the outset to have multiple syntactic stylesheets source code can be rendered as ascii text in unicode or as a prettied image this would allow for support of mathematical symbols and other symbols in the rendered output for easier reading an emacsbased tool called fortify transforms asciibased fortress source code into latex output fortress was also designed to be both highly parallel and have rich functionality contained within libraries drawing from java for example the codice loop construct was a parallel operation which would not necessarily iterate in a strictly linear manner depending on the underlying implementation however the codice construct was a library function and could be replaced by another version of the programmers liking rather than being built into the language fortress designers made its syntax as close as possible to pseudocode and analyzed hundreds of computer science and mathematics papers courses books and journals using pseudocode to extract the common usage patterns of the english language and standard mathematical notation when used to represent algorithms in pseudocode then they made the compiler trying to maintain a onetoone correspondence between pseudocode and executable fortress history fortress was one of three languages created with funding from the high productivity computing systems project the others were x from ibm and chapel from cray inc in november  when darpa approved funding for the third phase of the hpcs project x and chapel were funded but fortress was not leading to uncertainty about the future of fortress in january  fortress was transformed into an opensource project with an opensource community people outside sun can write fortress code and test it using the opensource fortress interpreter version  of the fortress language specification was released in april  along with a compliant implementation targeting the java virtual machine in july  steele announced that active development on fortress would cease after a brief windingdown period citing complications with using fortresss type system on existing virtual machines example hello world this is the fortress version of the archetypal hello world program as presented in the fortress reference card the export statement makes the program executable and every executable program in fortress must implement the run function the file where the program is saved for compilation must have the same name as the one specified in the initial component statement the println function is what outputs the hello world words on the screen
