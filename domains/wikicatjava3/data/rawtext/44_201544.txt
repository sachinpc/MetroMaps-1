xvid xvid formerly xvid is a video codec library following the mpeg video coding standard specifically mpeg part  advanced simple profile asp it uses asp features such as bframes global and quarter pixel motion compensation lumi masking trellis quantization and h mpeg and custom quantization matrices xvid is a primary competitor of the divx pro codec in contrast with the divx codec which is proprietary software developed by divx inc xvid is free software distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license this also means that unlike the divx codec which is only available for a limited number of platforms xvid can be used on all platforms and operating systems for which the source code can be compiled history in january  divxnetworks founded opendivx as part of project mayo which was intended to be a home for open source multimedia projects opendivx was an opensource mpeg video codec based on a stripped down version of the momusys reference mpeg encoder the source code however was placed under a restrictive license and only members of the divx advanced research centre darc had write access to the project cvs in early  darc member sparky wrote an improved version of the encoding core called encore this was updated several times before in april it was removed from cvs without warning the explanation given by sparky was we our bosses decided that we are not ready to have it in public yet in july  developers started complaining about a lack of activity in the project the last cvs commit was several months old bugfixes were being ignored and promised documentation had not been written soon after darc released a beta version of their closedsource commercial divx  codec which was based on encore saying that what the community really wants is a winamp not a linux it was after this that a fork of opendivx was created using the latest version of encore that was downloaded before it was removed since then all the opendivx code has been replaced and xvid has been published under the gnu general public license patent issues as an implementation of mpeg part  xvid uses many patented technologies for this reason xvid x versions were not licensed in countries where these software patents are recognized with the x releases a gnu gpl v license is used with no explicit geographical restriction however the legal usage of xvid may still be restricted by local laws sigma designs controversy in july  sigma designs released an mpeg video codec called the realmagic mpeg video codec before long people testing this new codec found that it contained considerable portions of xvid code sigma designs was contacted and confirmed that a programmer had based realmagic on xvid but assured that all gpl code would be replaced to avoid copyright infringement when sigma designs released the supposedly rewritten realmagic codec the xvid developers immediately disassembled it and concluded that it still contained xvid code only rearranged in an attempt to disguise its presence the xvid developers decided to stop work and go public to force sigma designs to respect the terms of the gpl after articles were published in slashdot and the inquirer in august  sigma designs agreed to publish their source code playing xvid encoded files primarily due to concerns over patents the official xvid website does not provide binary versions of the xvid codec however it does link to supporting websites that provide video for windows codecs and directshow decoding filters for microsoft windows xvid is not a video format  it is a program codec for compressing and decompressing to the mpeg asp format since xvid uses mpeg advanced simple profile asp compression any video that is encoded with it is termed mpeg asp video  not xvid video  and can therefore be decoded with all mpeg asp compliant decoders this includes a large number of media players and decoders in particular all the ones based on the freeopen source libavcodec library from ffmpeg for example mplayer vlc ffdshow or perian xvid encoded files can be written to a cd or dvd and played in some not all divx compatible dvd players and media players however xvid can optionally encode video with advanced mpeg features that most divx certified settop players do not support files encoded with global motion compensation qpel mpeg quantization multiple bframes or files that exceed the video buffering verifier limitations may not play back properly on divx certified hardware devices for example xvid specifies three warp points for its implementation of global motion compensation as opposed to the single warp point implementation of divx enabling some of the more advanced encoding features can compromise player compatibility some issues exist with the custom quantization matrices used in tools such as autogk that automate encoding with xvid this can depending on the decoder chipset of the settop player in question produce videos that have unstable playback and artifacts however most recent model divx compatible dvd players have improved support for custom quantization matrices
