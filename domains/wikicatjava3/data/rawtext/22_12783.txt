gzip gzip is a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression the program was created by jeanloup gailly and mark adler as a free software replacement for the compress program used in early unix systems and intended for use by the gnu project the g is from gnu version  was first publicly released on  october  and version  followed in february  file format gzip is based on the deflate algorithm which is a combination of lz and huffman coding deflate was intended as a replacement for lzw and other patentencumbered data compression algorithms which at the time limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers gzip is often also used to refer to the gzip file format which is although its file format also allows for multiple such streams to be concatenated zipped files are simply decompressed concatenated as if they were originally one file gzip is normally used to compress just single files compressed archives are typically created by assembling collections of files into a single tar archive and then compressing that archive with gzip the final or file is usually called a tarball gzip is not to be confused with the zip archive format which also uses deflate the zip format can hold collections of files without an external archiver but is less compact than compressed tarballs holding the same data because it compresses files individually and cannot take advantage of redundancy between files solid compression implementations various implementations of the program have been written the most commonly known is the gnu projects implementation using lempelziv coding lz openbsds version of gzip is actually the compress program to which support for the gzip format was added in openbsd  the g in this specific version stands for gratis freebsd dragonflybsd and netbsd use a bsdlicensed implementation instead of the gnu version it is actually a commandline interface for zlib intended to be compatible with the gnu implementations options these implementations originally come from netbsd and supports decompression of bzip and the unix pack format derivatives and other uses the tar utility included in most linux distributions can extract targz files by passing the option eg  zlib is an abstraction of the deflate algorithm in library form which includes support both for the gzip file format and a lightweight stream format in its api the zlib stream format deflate and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as rfc  rfc  and rfc  the gzip format is used in http compression a technique used to speed up the sending of html and other content on the world wide web it is one of the three standard formats for http compression as specified in rfc  this rfc also specifies a zlib format called deflate which is equal to the gzip format except that gzip adds eleven bytes of overhead in the form of headers and trailers still the gzip format is sometimes recommended over zlib because microsoft internet explorer does not implement the standard correctly and cannot handle the zlib format as specified in rfc  zlib deflate is used internally by the portable network graphics png format since the late s bzip a file compression utility based on a blocksorting algorithm has gained some popularity as a gzip replacement it produces considerably smaller files especially for source code and other structured text but at the cost of memory and processing time up to a factor of  advancecomp and zip can produce gzipcompatible files using an internal deflate implementation with better compression ratios than gzip itselfat the cost of more processor time compared to the reference implementation
