bdj bdj or bluray disc java is a specification supporting java me specifically the personal basis profile of the connected device configuration or cdc xlets for advanced content on bluray disc and the packaged media profile of globally executable mhp gem bdj allows bonus content on bluray disc titles to be far more sophisticated than bonus content provided by standard dvd including network access pictureinpicture and access to expanded local storage collectively these features other than internet access are referred to as bonus view and the addition of internet access is called bd live bdj was developed by the bluray disc association all bluray disc players supporting video content are required by the specification to support bdj starting on october   all new players are required to have hardware support for the bonus view features but the players may require future firmware updates to enable the features bd live support is always optional for a bd player sonys playstation  has been the de facto leader in compliance and support of bdj the playstation  added bluray profile  support with a firmware upgrade and was used to showcase bdlive at ces  in january content development content authors have a variety of development strategies available including the use of traditional integrated development environments ides like netbeans or eclipse nonprogramming graphical environments similar to macromedia director or via rendering engines which consume standard data formats such as html xml or svg having a full programming environment available on every bluray disc player provides developers with a platform for creating content types not bound by the restrictions of standard dvd in addition to the standard bdj apis developers may make use of existing java libraries and application frameworks assuming they do not use features outside the constraints of the bdj platform include that java me only supports java version  class files a set of freely available tools that allow java developers to produce complete disc images incorporating bdj is available from the hd cookbook project in order to test content in a typical development environment ms windows one needs either a playstation  or a thirdparty software player for windows paying attention to player versions to ensure that the player supports bdj because of the many different standards and components involved creating unified documentation on bdj has proven to be a challenge sample code the bdj environment is designed to run xlets with non packages available to take advantage of the features particular to this platform beyond that defined by java tv even a simple example such as firstbdjapp a developer might choose to use not packages and instead use a working example of a program using some features from each of the class trees would be the bdjgunbunny xlet a very simple version of space invaders using an image of a rabbit as the shooter and turtles as the targets provided as an example in the java me  sdk and the same for the other non packages likewise when trying to play a video one might call the bluray and davic utility rather than using generic jmf
