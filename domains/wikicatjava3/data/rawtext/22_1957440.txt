faac faac or freeware advanced audio coder is a software project which includes the aac encoder faac and decoder faad it supports mpeg aac as well as mpeg aac it supports several mpeg audio object types lc main ltp for encoding and sbr ps er ld for decoding file formats adts aac raw aac mp multichannel and gapless encodingdecoding and mp metadata tags the encoder and decoder is compatible with standardcompliant audio applications using one or more of these object types and facilities it also supports digital radio mondiale faac and faad being distributed in c source code form can be compiled on various platforms and are distributed free of charge faad is free software faac contains some code which is published as free software but as a whole it is only distributed under a proprietary license faac was originally written by menno bakker faac encoder faac stands for freeware advanced audio coder the faac encoder is an audio compression computer program that creates aac mpeg aacmpeg aac sound files from other formats usually cdda audio files it contains a library libfaac that can be used by other programs aac files are commonly used in computer programs and portable music players being apple incs recommended format for the companys ipod music player some of the features that faac has are crossplatform support reasonably fast encoding support for more than one object type of the aac format multichannel encoding and support for digital radio mondiale streams it also supports multichannel streams like  the mpeg object types of the aac format supported by faac are the low complexity lc main and long term prediction ltp the mpeg aac profiles supported by faac are lc and main the sbr and ps object types are not supported so the heaac and heaacv profiles are also not supported the object type low complexity is the default and also happens to be used in videos meant to be playable for portable players like apples ipod and used by videohosting sites like youtube faac has been evaluated as a somewhat lower quality option than other aac encoders alternatives for aac encoding in unixlike operating systems faac is one of six alternatives that linuxunix users have for creating aac files the others are faad decoder faad is freeware advanced audio aac decoder including sbr decoding it is mpeg and mpeg aac decoder and supports mpeg audio object types lc main ltp ld er sbr and ps which can be combined also to heaac and heaacv profile aac lcsbrps it contains a library libfaad that can be used by other programs faad and faad were originally written by menno bakker from nero ag faad is the successor to faad which was deprecated faad is freeware advanced audio decoder it was first released in  and it did not support sbr and ps audio object types the last version of faad was  all development later focused in faad the sbr decoding support heaac was added in the version release on  july  faad version  was released on  february  licensing faac contains code based on the iso mpeg reference code whose license is not compatible with the lgpl license only the faac changes to this iso mpeg reference code are licensed under the lgpl license the iso mpeg reference software was published as isoiec  mpeg part  reference software and it is freely available for download from iso website isoiec gives users of the mpeg nbcmpeg audio standards free license to this software module or modifications thereof for use in hardware or software products claiming conformance to the mpeg nbcmpeg audio standards those intending to use this software module in hardware or software products are advised that this use may infringe existing patents faad is licensed under the gpl v and later gpl versions code from faad is copyright of nero ag the appropriate copyright message mentioned in section c of the gplv the source code contains a note that the use of this software may require the payment of patent royalties commercial nongpl licensing of this software is also possible faad faad modifications to the iso mpeg aac reference code were distributed under the gpl other software faac and faad is used in the following software products and libraries there is also other software that uses faac libraries
