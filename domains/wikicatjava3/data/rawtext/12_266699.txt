msdosbased computer program named nutshell  developed by nashoba systems of concord massachusetts in the early s nutshell was distributed by leading edge an electronics marketer that had recently started selling ibm pccompatible computers with the introduction of the macintosh nashoba combined the basic data engine with a new formsbased graphical user interface gui leading edge was not interested in newer versions preferring to remain a dosonly vendor and kept the nutshell name nashoba found another distributor forethought inc and introduced the program on the macintosh platform as filemaker when apple introduced the macintosh plus in  the next version of filemaker was named filemaker plus to reflect the new models name forethought was purchased by microsoft which was then introducing their powerpoint product that became part of microsoft office microsoft had introduced its own database application microsoft file shortly before filemaker but it was outsold by filemaker and microsoft discontinued it microsoft negotiated with nashoba for the right to publish filemaker but nashoba decided to selfpublish the next version filemaker  shortly thereafter apple computer formed claris a wholly owned subsidiary to market software claris purchased nashoba to round out its software suite by then leading edge and nutshell had faded from the marketplace because of competition from other dos and later windowsplatform database products filemaker however continued to succeed on the macintosh platform claris changed the products name to filemaker ii to conform to its naming scheme for other products such as macwrite ii but the product changed little from the last nashoba version several minor versions followed and things finally settled down with the release of filemaker pro  in  in september  claris released a multiplatform version for both the mac and windows except for a few platformspecific functions the programs features and user interface were the same up to this point filemaker had no real relational feature it was limited to automatically looking up and importing values from other files it only had the ability to save a statea filter and a sort and a layout for the data version  released around  introduced new relational and scripting features by  filemaker was the only strongselling product in clariss lineup in  apple moved development of some of the other claris products inhouse dropped most of the rest and changed clariss name to filemaker inc to concentrate on that product major updates version  introduced in  added a plugin architecture much like that of adobe photoshop which enabled thirdparty developers to add features to filemaker a bundled plugin the web companion allowed the database to act as a web server other

changes filemaker inc also introduced a developer certification program in  filemaker inc announced the filemaker  product family which offered the developer an expanded feature set these included a

product has now become a single client for both these handhelds and the server admin tool now runs in html no longer requiring a java app filemaker  platform released on may   this included filemaker pro  filemaker pro  advanced filemaker server  and filemaker go  version history filemaker files are compatible between mac and windows file type extensions are selfrunning applications runtime kiosk mode are platformspecific only dynamic markup language the filemaker dynamic markup language or fdml was a markup language used in the earlier versions of filemaker introduced in  fdml is also often referred to as claris dynamic markup language or cdml named after the old company claris fdml was an extension of html that used special tags such as codice to display filemaker data on web pages filemaker officially dropped support for fdml in  internationalization and localization filemaker  is available in worldwide english simplified chinese dutch french german italian japanese korean portuguese brazilian spanish and swedish there are also specific versions of filemaker for users of central european indian and middle eastern languages the custom versions offer spell checking data entry sorting and printing options for languages of the respective region they also contain localized templates and localized instant web publishing the central european version filemaker  includes english russian polish czech and turkish interfaces there are customized templates for russian polish czech turkish in addition russian greek estonian lithuanian latvian serbian bulgarian and hungarian are supported to varying degrees the version intended for southeast asian languages has only an english user interface but supports indiclanguage data entry sorting and indexing in hindi marathi bengali panjabi gujarati tamil telugu kannada and malayalam similarly the middle eastern version has only english and french user interfaces but with its option to change the text direction to

tasks and complex calculations numerous steps are available for navigation conditional execution of script steps editing records and other utilities filemaker pro advanced provides a script debugger which allows the developer to set break points monitor data values and step through script lines filemaker  introduces a useful script that more deeply queries container field document meta data sql and odbc support filemaker since version  includes the ability to connect to a number of sql databases without resorting to using sql including mysql sql server and oracle this requires installation of the sql database odbc driver in many cases a thirdparty license per client driver to connect to a sql database sql databases can be used as data sources in filemakers relationship graph thus allowing the developer to create new layouts based on the sql database create edit and delete sql records via filemaker layouts and functions and reference sql fields in filemaker calculations and script steps it is a cross platform relational database application versions from filemaker pro  onwards also have an odbc interface filemaker  introduced a new function executesql which allows the user to perform an sql query against the filemaker database to retrieve data but not for modification or deletion or schema changes one major flaw with odbc support is the lack of  field type mapping from filemaker to external industry standard databases further issues are caused by the fact that filemaker is not strict in its data types a filemaker field can be marked as numerical and will return this mapping to an odbc driver  however filemaker allows nonnumerical characters to be stored in this numeric field type unless the field is specifically marked ad strictly numerical
