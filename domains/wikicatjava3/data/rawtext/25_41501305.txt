telegram software telegram is a cloudbased instant messaging service telegram clients exist for both mobile android ios windows phone ubuntu touch and desktop systems windows os x linux users can send messages and exchange photos videos stickers and files of any type telegram also provides optional endtoendencrypted messaging which has been criticized by security experts because of its custom nature telegram is supported by the russianborn entrepreneur pavel durov who is now a citizen of saint kitts and nevis travelling the world in selfimposed exile its clientside code is opensource software whereas its serverside code is closedsourced and proprietary the service also provides apis to independent developers history development telegram was launched in  by brothers nikolai and pavel durov who previously founded the russian social network vk but had to leave the company after it was taken over by mailru nikolai durov created the mtproto protocol that is the basis for the messenger while pavel provided financial support and infrastructure through his digital fortress fund telegram is registered as both an english llp and an american llc it does not disclose where it rents offices or which legal entities it uses to rent them citing the need to shelter the team from unnecessary influence and protect users from governmental data requests the service says that it is headquartered in berlin germany durov left russia and is said to be moving from country to country with a small group of computer programmers usage numbers in october  telegram had  daily active users on  march  telegram announced that it had reached  million monthly users and  million daily active users in october  south korean governmental surveillance plans drove many of its citizens to switch to telegram in december  telegram announced they had  million active users generating  billion daily messages and that they had  million new users signing up on their service every week traffic doubled in five months with  billion daily messages in september  an announcement stated that the app had  million active users and delivered  billion daily messages in february  telegram announced that they had  million monthly active users with  new users signing up every day delivering  billion messages daily features account telegram accounts are tied to telephone numbers and are verified by sms or phone call users can add multiple devices to their account and receive messages on each one connected devices can be removed individually or all at once the associated number can be changed at any time and when doing so the users contacts will receive the new number automatically in addition a user can set up an alias that allows them to send and receive messages without exposing their phone number accounts can be deleted at any time and they are deleted automatically after six months of inactivity by default which can optionally be changed to  to  months users can replace exact last seen timestamps with fudged messages such as last seen within a week the default method of authentication that telegram uses for logins is smsbased singlefactor authentication all that is needed in order to log in to an account and gain access to that users cloudbased messages is a onetime passcode that is sent via sms to the users phone number these login sms messages are known to have been intercepted in iran russia and germany possibly in coordination with phone companies pavel durov has said that telegram users in troubled countries should enable twofactor authentication by creating passwords which telegram allows but does not require cloudbased messages telegrams default messages are cloudbased and can be accessed on any of the users connected devices users can share photos videos audio messages and other files up to  gigabyte in size users can send messages to other users individually or to groups of up to  members the transmission of messages to telegram messenger llps servers is encrypted with the services mtproto protocol according to telegrams privacy policy all data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other dcs in different jurisdictions this way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data bots in june  telegram launched a platform for thirdparty developers to create bots bots are telegram accounts operated by programs they can respond to messages or mentions can be invited into groups and can be integrated into other programs dutch website tweakers reported that an invited bot can potentially read all group messages when the bot controller changes the access settings silently at a later point in time telegram pointed out that it considered implementing a feature that would announce such a status change within the relevant group channels channels can be created for broadcasting messages to an unlimited number of subscribers channels can be publicly available with an alias and a permanent url so anyone can join users who join a channel can see the entire message history each message has its own view counter showing how many users have seen this message users can join and leave channels at any time furthermore users can mute a channel meaning that the user will still receive messages but wont be notified stickers stickers are cloudbased highdefinition images intended to provide more expressive emoji when typing in an emoji the user is offered to send the respective sticker instead stickers come in collections called sets and multiple stickers can be offered for one emoji telegram comes with one default sticker set but users can install additional sticker sets provided by thirdparty contributors sticker sets installed from one client become automatically available to all other clients secret chats messages can also be sent with clienttoclient encryption in socalled secret chats these messages are encrypted with the services mtproto protocol unlike telegrams cloudbased messages messages sent within a secret chat can be accessed only on the device upon which the secret chat was initiated and the device upon which the secret chat was accepted they cannot be accessed on other devices messages sent within secret chats can in principle be deleted at any time and can optionally selfdestruct secret chats have to be initiated and accepted by an invitation upon which the encryption keys for the session are exchanged users in a secret chat can verify that no maninthemiddle attack has occurred by comparing pictures that visualize their public key fingerprints according to telegram secret chats have supported perfect forward secrecy since december  encryption keys are periodically changed after a key has been used more than  times or has been in use for more than a week old encryption keys are destroyed telegrams local message database is not encrypted by default some telegram clients allow users to encrypt the local message database by setting a passphrase architecture encryption scheme telegram uses a symmetric encryption scheme called mtproto the protocol was developed by nikolai durov and other developers at telegram and is based on bit symmetric aes encryption rsa  encryption and diffiehellman key exchange since  cryptography experts have expressed both doubts and criticisms on the mtproto encryption scheme saying that deploying homebrewed and unproven cryptography may render the encryption vulnerable to bugs that potentially undermine its security due to a lack of scrutiny it has also been suggested that telegram did not employ developers with sufficient expertise or credibility in this field in december  two researchers from aarhus university published a report in which they demonstrated that mtproto does not achieve indistinguishability under chosenciphertext attack indcca or authenticated encryption the former means that it is possible to turn any ciphertext into a different ciphertext that decrypts to the same message the researchers stressed that the attack was of a theoretical nature and they did not see any way of turning the attack into a full plaintextrecovery attack nevertheless they said they saw no reason why telegram should use a less secure encryption scheme when more secure and at least as efficient solutions exist servers telegram messenger llp has servers in a number of countries throughout the world to improve the response time of their service telegrams serverside software is closedsource and proprietary pavel durov has said that it would require a major architectural redesign of the serverside software to connect independent servers to the telegram cloud client applications telegram has various clients this list includes versions developed on official platforms backed by telegram messenger llp and unofficial clients that are developed by the community the source code of all official telegram clients and some of the unofficial clients is open source and released under the gnu general public licence or  users can also access telegrams cloudbased messages via an official web browser interface called telegram web aka webogram users can share images files and emoticons with previouslyadded contacts this works in most modern browsers such as firefox safari and google chrome apis telegram has public apis with which developers can access the same functionality as telegrams official apps to build their own messaging applications in february  creators of the unofficial whatsapp client released the telegram plus app after their original project got a ceaseanddesist order from whatsapp in september  samsung released a messaging application based on these apis telegram also offers an api that allows developers to create bots which are accounts controlled by programs in february  forbes launched an aipowered news bot that pushes popular stories to subscribers and replies to search queries with relevant articles techcrunch launched a similar bot in march  reception security on  february  the german consumer organisation stiftung warentest had evaluated several dataprotection aspects of telegram along with other popular instantmessaging clients among the aspects considered were the security of the data transmission the services terms of use the accessibility of the source code and the distribution of the app telegram was rated critical  overall the organisation was favourable to telegrams secure chats and partially open source code but criticised the mandatory transfer of contact data to telegrams servers and the lack of an imprint or address on the services website it noted that while the message data is encrypted on the device it could not analyse the transmission due to a lack of source code the electronic frontier foundation eff listed telegram on its secure messaging scorecard in february  telegrams default chat function received a score of  out of  points on the scorecard it received points for having communications encrypted in transit having its code open to independent review having the security design properly documented and having completed a recent independent security audit telegrams default chat function missed points because the communications were not encrypted with keys the provider didnt have access to users could not verify contacts identities and past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen telegrams optional secret chat function which provides endtoend encryption received a score of  out of  points on the scorecard the eff said that the results should not be read as endorsements of individual tools or guarantees of their security and that they were merely indications that the projects were on the right track in april  accounts of several russian opposition members were hijacked by intercepting the sms messages used for login authorization in response telegram recommended using the optional twofactor authentication feature in may  the committee to protect journalists and nate cardozo senior staff attorney at electronic frontier foundation recommended against using telegram because of its lack of endtoend encryption by default and its use of nonstandard mtproto encryption protocol which has been publicly criticized by cryptography researchers including matthew green telegrams faq claims it is more secure than mass market messengers like whatsapp and line in mayjune  telegram was criticized for making this claim because whatsapp applies endtoend encryption to all of its traffic by default and uses a protocol that has been reviewed and endorsed by leading security experts while telegram does neither since july  line has also applied endtoend encryption to all of its messages by default cryptography contests telegram has organised two cryptography contests to challenge its own security third parties were asked to break the services cryptography and disclose the information contained within a secret chat between two computercontrolled users a reward of respectively and was offered both of these contests expired with no winners security researcher moxie marlinspike and commenters on hacker news criticised the first contest for being rigged or framed in telegrams favour and said that telegrams statements on the value of these contests as proof of the cryptographys quality are misleading censorship telegram was open and working in iran without any vpn or other circumvention methods in may  in august  the iranian ministry of ict asserted that telegram had agreed to restrict some of its bots and sticker packs in iran at the request of the iranian government according to an article published on global voices these features were being used by iranians to share porn and satirical comments about the iranian government the article also noted that some users are concerned that telegrams willingness to comply with iranian government requests might mean future complicity with other iranian government censorship or even allow government access to telegrams data on iranian users telegram has stated that all telegram chats are private territory and that they do not process any requests related to them only requests regarding public content bots and sticker packs will be processed in may  the iranian government asked all messaging apps including telegram to move all iranian users data to iranian servers use by terrorists in september  in response to a question about the use of telegram by extremists like isil pavel durov stated i think that privacy ultimately and our right for privacy is more important than our fear of bad things happening like terrorism isil has recommended telegram to its supporters and members and in october  they were able to double the number of followers of their official channel to  in november  telegram announced that it had blocked  public channels operated by isil which were used for spreading propaganda and mass communication telegram stated that it would block public channels and bots that are related to terrorism but it would not honour politicallymotivated censorship based on local restrictions on freedom of speech and that it allowed peaceful expression of alternative opinions telegrams usage for isils propaganda has reignited the encryption debate and encrypted messaging applications have faced new scrutiny in august  french antiterrorism investigators asserted that the two isildirected jihadists who fatally cut the throat of a priest in sainttiennedurouvray in normandy france and videoed the murder had communicated via telegram and used the app to coordinate their plans for the attack isils media wing subsequently posted a video on telegram showing the pair pledging allegiance a cnn news report stated that telegram has become known as a preferred means of communication for the sunni terror group isis and was used by the isis cell that plotted the paris terror attacks in november
