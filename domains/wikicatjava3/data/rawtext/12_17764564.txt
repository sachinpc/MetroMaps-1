clozure cl clozure cl ccl is a common lisp implementation it implements the full ansi common lisp standard with several extensions clos mop threads clos conditions clos streams  it contains a command line development environment an experimental integrated development environment ide for mac os x using the hemlock editor and can also be used with slime a common lisp development environment for gnu emacs clozure cl is open source and the project is hosted by clozure associates supported platforms clozure cl supports the mac os x linux freebsd solaris and microsoft windows platforms there are  and  bit x variants for each additionally there are powerpc ports for mac os x and linux and a bit arm port for linux applications clozure cl is used by ita software for the business logic of a new airline reservation system for air canada clozure cl is also commonly used as an underlying common lisp implementation for the acl theorem prover history formerly known as openmcl clozure cl is an evolution of macintosh common lisp technology ccl contains a precise generational compacting garbage collector ccls compiler produces native instructions for lisp expressions and files by default every expression entered at the repl is compiled to native code lisp threads are implemented as preemptivelyscheduled native operatingsystem threads ccl implements builtin facilities to easily interface with c and objectivec libraries cocoa bridge and these are used to implement the ide amongst other things the ide based upon the hemlock editor is currently labelled as experimental an effort is underway to improve this
