simple directmedia layer simple directmedia layer sdl is a crossplatform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer to computer multimedia hardware components software developers can use it to write highperformance computer games and other multimedia applications that can run on many operating systems such as android ios linux macosx windows and other platforms sdl manages video audio input devices cdrom threads shared object loading networking and timers for d graphics it can handle an opengl or directd context the library is internally written in c and depending on the target platform c or objectivec and provides the application programming interface in c with bindings to other languages available it is free and opensource software subject to the requirements of the zlib license since version  and with prior versions subject to the gnu lesser general public license under the zlib license sdl  is freely available for static linking in closedsource projects unlike sdl  sdl is extensively used in the industry in both large and small projects over  games  applications and  demos have also been posted on the library website a common misconception is that sdl is a game engine but this is not true however the library is wellsuited for building an engine on top of it history sam lantinga created the library first releasing it in early  while working for loki software he got the idea while porting a windows application to macintosh he then used sdl to port doom to beos see doom source ports several other free libraries were developed to work alongside sdl such as smpeg and openal he also founded galaxy gameworks in  to help commercially support sdl although the company plans are currently on hold due to time constraints soon after putting galaxy gameworks on hold lantinga announced that sdl  which would then later become sdl  would be licensed under the zlib license lantinga announced sdl  on  july  at the same time announcing that he was joining valve corporation the first version of which was announced the same day he joined the company lantinga announced the stable release of sdl  on  august  sdl  is a major update to the sdl  codebase with a different not backwardscompatible api it replaces several parts of the  api with more general support for multiple input and output options some feature additions include multiple window support hardwareaccelerated d graphics and better unicode support support for mir and wayland was added in sdl  and enabled by default in sdl  better support for android in forthcoming  software architecture sdl is a wrapper around the operatingsystemspecific functions that the game needs to access the only purpose of sdl is to provide a common framework for accessing these functions for multiple operating systems crossplatform sdl provides support for d pixel operations sound file access event handling timing and threading it is often used to complement opengl by setting up the graphical output and providing mouse and keyboard input since opengl comprises only rendering a game using the simple directmedia layer will not automatically run on every operating system further adaptations must be applied these are reduced to the minimum since sdl also contains a few abstraction apis for frequent functions offered by an operating system the syntax of sdl is functionbased all operations done in sdl are done by passing parameters to subroutines functions special structures are also used to store the specific information sdl needs to handle there are a few different subsystems sdl categorizes its functions under sdl can be used instead of xinput and xaudio subsystems sdl is divided into several subsystems besides this basic lowlevel support there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions these comprise the standard library and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation other nonstandard libraries also exist for example sdlcollide on sourceforge created by amir taaki language bindings the sdl  library has language bindings for c c pascal python via pysdl c lua ocaml rust nim vala and genie supported backends because of the way sdl is designed much of its source code is split into separate modules for each operating system to make calls to the underlying system when sdl is compiled the appropriate modules are selected for the target system following backends are available sdl  has support for risc os dropped in  an unofficial sixel backend is available for sdl  reception and adoption over the years sdl was used for many commercial and noncommercial video game projects for instance mobygames listed  games using sdl in  and the sdl website itself listed around  games in  important commercial examples are angry birds or unreal tournament from the open source domain openttd the battle for wesnoth or freeciv the crossplatform game releases of the popular humble indie bundles for linux mac and android are often sdl based sdl is also often used for later ports on new platforms with existing legacy code for instance the pc game homeworld was ported to the pandora handheld and jagged alliance  for android via sdl also several non video game software uses sdl examples are the emulators dosbox and visualboyadvance there were several books written for the development with sdl see further readings sdl is used in university courses teaching multimedia and computer science for instance in a workshop about game programming using libsdl at the university of cadiz in  or a game design discipline at utfpr ponta grossa campus in
