unified expression language the java unified expression language is a special purpose programming language mostly used in java web applications for embedding expressions into web pages the java specification writers and expert groups of the java webtier technologies have worked on a unified expression language which was first included in the jsp  specification jsr and later specified by itself in jsr part of java ee  history the expression language started out as part of the javaserver pages standard tag library jstl and was originally called spel simplest possible expression language then just expression language el it was a scripting language which allowed access to java components javabeans through jsp since jsp  it has been used inside jsp tags to separate java code from jsp and to allow easier access to java components than in java code over the years the expression language has evolved to include more advanced functionality and it was included in the jsp  specification scripting was made easier for webcontent designers who have little or practically no knowledge of the core java language this scripting language made jsp a scripting language in the true sense before el jsp consisted of some special tags like scriptlets expressions etc within which java code was written explicitly with el the webcontent designer needs only to know how to make proper calls to core java methods el was both syntactically and semantically similar to javascript expressions el also liberated the programmer from having to know the particularities of how the values are actually accessed codice can mean depending on what the codice is either codice or codice or codice etc during the development of jsp  the javaserver faces technology was released which also needed an expression language but the expression language defined in the jsp  specification didnt satisfy all the needs for development with jsf technology the most obvious limitations were that its expressions were evaluated immediately and the jsf components could not invoke methods on serverside objects a more powerful language was created with the following new features the new expression language worked well for the purposes of jsf but developers had problems when integrating the jsp el with the jsf el because of conflicts because of these incompatibilities the unified expression language initiative was started to unify these expression languages as of jsp  the expression languages of jsp  and jsf  have been merged into a single unified expression language el  version  of the expression language the unified was no longer deemed necessary was developed in a jsr independent of the jsp and jsf specifications in jsr  some new features were added most notably el equivalents of java s streams and lambda expressions features the new unified el is a union of the jsp and jsf expression languages in addition to the features already available in the jsp el the unified el has the following features examples this shows a simple example of unified el being used within a jstl cout tag an expression that calls a method with a parameter
