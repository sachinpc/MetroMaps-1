sac programming language sac single assignment c is a strict purely functional programming language whose design is focused on the needs of numerical applications emphasis is laid on efficient support for array processing efficiency concerns are essentially twofold on the one hand efficiency in program development is to be improved by the opportunity to specify array operations on a high level of abstraction on the other hand efficiency in program execution ie the runtime performance of programs in time and memory consumption is still to be achieved by sophisticated compilation schemes only as far as the latter succeeds the highlevel style of specifications can actually be called useful to facilitate compiling to efficiently executable code certain functional language features which are not considered essential for numerical applications eg higherorder functions polymorphism or lazy evaluation are not yet supported by sac these may be found in generalpurpose functional languages eg haskell clean miranda or ml to overcome the acceptance problems encountered by other functional or array based languages intended for numerical  array intensive applications eg sisal nesl nial apl j or k particular regard is paid to ease the transition from a c  fortran like programming environment to sac in more detail the basic language design goals of sac are to
