deeplearningj deeplearningj is a deep learning programming library written for java and the java virtual machine jvm and a computing framework with wide support for deep learning algorithms deeplearningj includes implementations of the restricted boltzmann machine deep belief net deep autoencoder stacked denoising autoencoder and recursive neural tensor network wordvec docvec and glove these algorithms all include distributed parallel versions that integrate with apache hadoop and spark deeplearningj is opensource software released under apache license  developed mainly by a machine learning group in san francisco led by adam gibson it is supported commercially by the startup skymind it is the only opensource project listed on googles wordvec page for its java implementation introduction deeplearningj relies on the widely used programming language java though it is compatible with clojure and includes a scala application programming interface api it is powered by its own opensource numerical computing library ndj and works with both central processing units cpus and graphics processing units gpus deeplearningj has been used in several commercial and academic applications the code is hosted on github a support forum is maintained on gitter the framework is composable meaning shallow neural nets such as restricted boltzmann machines convolutional nets autoencoders and recurrent nets can be added to one another to create deep nets of varying types it also has extensive visualization tools and a computation graph distributed training with deeplearningj occurs in a cluster neural nets are trained in parallel via iterative reduce which works on hadoopyarn and on spark deeplearningj also integrates with cuda kernels to conduct pure gpu operations and works with distributed gpus scientific computing for the jvm deeplearningj includes an ndimensional array class using ndj that allows scientific computing in java and scala similar to the functions that numpy provides to python its effectively based on a library for linear algebra and matrix manipulation in a production environment datavec vectorization library for machinelearning datavec vectorizes various file formats and data types using an inputoutput format system similar to hadoops use of mapreduce that is it turns various data types into columns of scalars termed vectors datavec is designed to vectorize csvs images sound text video and time series text and nlp deeplearningj includes a vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit implemented in java and integrating with parallel gpus for performance it is designed to handle large text sets deeplearningj includes implementations of term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf deep learning and mikolovs wordvec algorithm docvec and glove reimplemented and optimized in java it relies on tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne for wordcloud visualizations realworld use cases and integrations realworld use cases for deeplearningj include fraud detection for the financial sector anomaly detection in industries such as manufacturing recommender systems in ecommerce and advertising and image recognition deeplearningj has integrated with other machinelearning platforms such as rapidminer and predictionio
