java servlet a java servlet is a java program that extends the capabilities of a server although servlets can respond to any types of requests they most commonly implement applications hosted on web servers such web servlets are the java counterpart to other dynamic web content technologies such as php and aspnet introduction servlets are most often used to process or store a java class in java ee that conforms to the java servlet api a standard for implementing java classes that respond to requests servlets could in principle communicate over any clientserver protocol but they are most often used with the http protocol thus servlet is often used as shorthand for http servlet thus a software developer may use a servlet to add dynamic content to a web server using the java platform the generated content is commonly html but may be other data such as xml servlets can maintain state in session variables across many server transactions by using http cookies or rewriting urls to deploy and run a servlet a web container must be used a web container also known as a servlet container is essentially the component of a web server that interacts with the servlets the web container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets mapping a url to a particular servlet and ensuring that the url requester has the correct access rights the servlet api contained in the java package hierarchy  defines the expected interactions of the web container and a servlet a is an object that receives a request and generates a response based on that request the basic servlet package defines java objects to represent servlet requests and responses as well as objects to reflect the servlets configuration parameters and execution environment the package defines httpspecific subclasses of the generic servlet elements including session management objects that track multiple requests and responses between the web server and a client servlets may be packaged in a war file as a web application servlets can be generated automatically from java server pages jsp by the javaserver pages compiler the difference between servlets and jsp is that servlets typically embed html inside java code while jsps embed java code in html while the direct usage of servlets to generate html as shown in the example below has become rare the higher level mvc web framework in java ee jsf still explicitly uses the servlet technology for the low level requestresponse handling via the facesservlet a somewhat older usage is to use servlets in conjunction with jsps in a pattern called model  which is a flavor of the modelviewcontroller the current version of servlet is  history the servlet specification was created by sun microsystems with version  finalized in june  starting with version  the specification was developed under the java community process jsr  defined both the servlet  and javaserver page  specifications jsr  specifies the servlet  and  specifications as of june   the current version of the servlet specification is  in his blog on javanet sun veteran and glassfish lead jim driscoll details the history of servlet technology james gosling first thought of servlets in the early days of java but the concept did not become a product until sun shipped the product this was before what is now the java platform enterprise edition was made into a specification compared with other web application models the advantages of using servlets are their fast performance and ease of use combined with more power over traditional cgi common gateway interface traditional cgi scripts written in java have a number of performance disadvantages technologies like fastcgi and its derivatives including scgi ajp do not exhibit the performance disadvantages of cgi incurred by the constant process spawning they are however roughly as simple as cgi they are therefore also in contrast with servlets which are substantially more complex life cycle of a servlet three methods are central to the life cycle of a servlet these are codice codice and codice they are implemented by every servlet and are invoked at specific times by the server the following is a typical user scenario of these methods example the following example servlet prints how many times its codice method was called note that codice is a subclass of codice an implementation of the codice interface the codice method of codice class dispatches requests to the methods codice codice codice codice and so on according to the http request in the example below codice is overridden and does not distinguish which http request method it serves import javaioioexception import javaxservletservletconfig import javaxservletservletexception import javaxservlethttphttpservlet import
