hibernate framework hibernate orm hibernate in short is an objectrelational mapping framework for the java language it provides a framework for mapping an objectoriented domain model to a relational database hibernate solves objectrelational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct persistent database accesses with highlevel object handling functions hibernate is free software that is distributed under the gnu lesser general public license  hibernates primary feature is mapping from java classes to database tables and mapping from java data types to sql data types hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities it generates sql calls and relieves the developer from manual handling and object conversion of the result set mapping the mapping of java classes to database tables is implemented by the configuration of an xml file or by using java annotations when using an xml file hibernate can generate skeleton source code for the persistence classes this is auxiliary when annotations are used hibernate can use the xml file or the java annotations to maintain the database schema there are provided facilities to arrange onetomany and manytomany relationships between classes in addition to managing associations between objects hibernate can also manage reflexive associations wherein an object has a onetomany relationship with other instances of the class type hibernate supports the mapping of custom value types this makes the following scenarios possible definition objects in a objectoriented application follow oop principles while objects in the backend follow database normalization principles resulting in different representation requirements this problem is called objectrelational impedance mismatch mapping is a way of resolving the objectrelational impedance mismatch problem mapping informs the orm tool of what java class object to store in which database table hibernate query language hql hibernate provides an sql inspired language called hibernate query language hql which allows sqllike queries to be written against hibernates data objects criteria queries are provided as an objectoriented alternative to hql criteria query is used to modify the objects and provide the restriction for the objects hql hibernate query language is the objectoriented version of sql it generates the database independent queries so you dont need to write database specific queries before hibernate if the database is changed for the project the sql query needs to be changed as well this leads to maintenance problems persistence hibernate provides transparent persistence for plain old java objects pojos the only strict requirement for a persistent class is a noargument constructor not necessarily public proper behavior in some applications also requires special attention to the equals and hashcode methods collections of data objects are typically stored in java collection classes such as implementations of the set and list interfaces java generics introduced in java  are supported hibernate can be configured to lazy load associated collections lazy loading is the default as of hibernate  related objects can be configured to cascade operations from one to the other for example a parent album object can be configured to cascade its save andor delete operation to its child track objects integration hibernate can be used both in standalone java applications and in java ee applications using servlets ejb session beans and jbi service components it can also be included as a feature in other programming languages for example adobe integrated hibernate into version  of coldfusion which runs on jee app servers with an abstraction layer of new functions and syntax added into cfml entities and components in hibernate jargon an entity is a standalone object in hibernates persistent mechanism which can be manipulated independently of other objects in contrast a component is subordinate to an entity and can be manipulated only with respect to that entity for example an album object may represent an entity but the tracks object associated with the album objects would represent a component of the album entity if it is assumed that tracks can only be saved or retrieved from the database through the album object unlike jee hibernate can switch databases history hibernate was started in  by gavin king with colleagues from cirrus technologies as an alternative to using ejbstyle entity beans the original goal was to offer better persistence capabilities than those offered by ejb by simplifying the complexities and supplementing certain missing features in early  the hibernate development team began hibernate releases which offered many significant improvements over the first release jboss inc now part of red hat later hired the lead hibernate developers in order to further its development in  hibernate version  was released key features included a new interceptorcallback architecture user defined filters and jdk  annotations javas metadata feature  hibernate  version  and up was a certified implementation of the java persistence api  specification via a wrapper for the core module which provides conformity with the jsr  standard in dec  hibernate core  final was released this includes new features such as multitenancy support introduction of serviceregistry a major change in how hibernate builds and manages services better session opening from sessionfactory improved integration via orghibernateintegratorspiintegrator and auto discovery internationalization support message codes in logging and a more distinction between the api spi or implementation classes in dec  hibernate orm  final was released in mar  hibernate orm  final was released in dec  hibernate orm  final was released it features java persistence api  in sep  hibernate orm  final was released it has improved bootstrapping hibernatejava hibernatespatial karaf support application programming interface the hibernate api is provided in the java package orghibernate orghibernatesession interface represents a hibernate session ie the main point of the manipulation performed on the database entities the latter activities include among the other things managing the persistence state transient persisted detached of the objects fetching the persisted ones from the database and the management of the transaction demarcation a session is intended to last as long as the logical transaction on the database due to the latter feature session implementations are not expected to be thread safe nor to be used by multiple clients software components the hibernate software includes the following components
