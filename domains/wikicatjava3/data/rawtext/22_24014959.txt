freearc freearc is a free and open source file archiver developed by bulat ziganshin as of h  freearc next which is a native bit archiver rewritten from scratch is under heavy development algorithms freearc uses lzma prediction by partial matching trueaudio tornado and grzip algorithms with automatic switching by file type additionally it uses filters to further improve compression including rep finds repetitions at the distances up to gb dict dictionary replacements for texts delta improves compression of tables in binary data bcj executables preproccesor and lzp removes repetitions in texts benchmarks archive size in a  toms hardware benchmarks comparing it to the other popular archivers winzip zip and winrar freearc narrowly outperformed them by small margin in its best compression mode but lost to zips lzma in the default compression tests still compressing better than winrar and winzip at this setting speed in the same toms hardware tests freearc was outpaced at default settings by zips lzma default compression and also by winrar even at its best compression settings freearcs compression at its best settings was slower than both zip and winrar but still came ahead of winzip efficiency in a metric devised by werner bergmans of maximum compression benchmark freearc compression is more efficient than programs for classic formats like z lzw zip deflate gz or bzip the scoring formula used in this nonpublic test multiplies the sum of compression and decompression times with a factor that exponentially grades the ratio of archive sizes achieved by the program under test relative to the best known archive size for that data set as of november  freearc is the top program in this benchmark followed by nanozip bsc and winrar it works faster than winrar and zip features like rar and zip it is an archiver it is not just a data compressor like gzip or bzip initially it supported only its own archive format normally identified by the codice file name extension incompatible with others there is no relationship with other arc formats more recently decompression support for other archive types has been added as well including zip rar and z freearc has both a command line interface and a gui other features include supported platforms windows binaries are available from the developer there was no bit version as of january  but that may change as the program had not left its alpha stage of development yet linux binaries and source code are not available anymore freearc next in october  the first public release of freearc next was released its currently available only as a cli application for  and  bit windows and linux platforms new features include
