vertx vertx is a polyglot eventdriven application framework that runs on the java virtual machine similar environments written in other programming languages include nodejs for javascript twisted for python perl object environment for perl libevent for c and eventmachine for ruby as of version  vertx exposes its api in java javascript groovy ruby python scala clojure and ceylon as of version  vertx exposes its api in java javascript groovy ruby and ceylon history vertx was started by tim fox in  while he was employed by vmware fox initially named the project nodex a play on the naming of nodejs with the x representing the fact that the new project was polyglot in nature and didnt simply support javascript the project was later renamed to vertx to avoid any potential legal issues as node was a trademark owned by joyent inc the new name was also a play on the name node as a vertex is a synonym for a node in mathematics in december  after he left their employment vmware served legal papers on tim fox to take control of the vertx trademark domain name blog github account and google group from the vertx community after much discussion with other parties in january  vmware was persuaded that it would be in the best interests of the vertx community to move the project and associated ip to the eclipse foundation a neutral legal entity in august  the core vertx project completed its move to the eclipse foundation the other projects that make up the vertx stack did not migrate to eclipse but continued to use the vertx trademark with tacit approval of the eclipse foundation in may  vertx won the award for most innovative java technology at the jax innovation awards on january   tim fox stepped down as the lead of the vertx project and julien viet a long time contributor took his place architecture vertx uses low level io library netty the application framework includes these features examples a web server serving static files could be written in java and in clojure both cases will result in a web server serving content in a highly scalable manner note that these examples are not fit for production use since the server is open to directory traversal attacks more complete examples for web servers are available in the vertx examples repository
