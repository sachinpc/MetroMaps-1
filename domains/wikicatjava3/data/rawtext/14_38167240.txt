apache stanbol apache stanbol is an open source modular software stack and reusable set of components for semantic content management apache stanbol components are meant to be accessed over restful interfaces to provide semantic services for content management thus one application is to extend traditional content management systems with internal or external semantic services additionally apache stanbol lets you create new types of content management systems with semantics at their core the current code is written in java and based on the osgi component framework applications include extending existing content management systems with internal or external semantic services and creating new types of content management systems with semantics at their core history in  the salzburg research led as entity coordinator a consortium of seven research partners and six industrial partners to the proposal of the iks project with the aim of receiving funding by the european institutions under the th framework programme the consortium comprised in january  the interactive knowledge stack iks started partly funded by the european commission to provide an open source technology platform for semantically enhanced content management systems iks received m cofunding by the european union for an overall project duration of  years hence setting the projects end date by the end of  apache stanbol was founded in november  by members the eu research project interactive knowledge stack iks it was the result of an ongoing discussion about how to ensure that the results especially the developed software of the iks project would be available to vendors of content management systems cms after the projects official funding period ended in  the members of the iks project decided to initiate the apache stanbol project as part of the incubation program of the apache software foundation asf one of the first code imports of apache stanbol was the socalled furtwangen iks semantic engine fise which eventually became the apache stanbol enhancer with its enhancement engines other contributions of code were the kres knowledge representation and reasoning and the rick reference infrastructure for content and knowledge components later on followed the contenthub while kres was split into the apache stanbol ontology manager and reasoner components and the rick is today known as the apache stanbol entityhub from that moment apache stanbol was developed as an open source software project independent of the iks research project on  november  apache stanbol enters incubation on  may  version incubating is released on  july  version incubating is released by the middle of  apache stanbol had demonstrated that it has an active community and is able to produce software and releases according to the asf standards the board of directors of the asf accepted the formal resolution to establish apache stanbol as a toplevel project on  on  march  salzburg research announced that  entities among those sebastian schaffert head of the knowledge and media technologies group rupert westenthaler stanbol initial committer and pmc and sergio fernndez stanbol commiter set up an effort to deliver apache stanbol and apache marmotta services under the redlink brand main features apache stanbols main features are content enhancement services that add semantic information to nonsemantic pieces of content the apache stanbol enhancer provides both a restful and a java api that allows a caller to extract features from passed content in more detail the passed content is processed by enhancement engines as defined by the called enhancement chain reasoning services that are able to retrieve additional semantic information about the content based on the semantic information retrieved via content enhancement the stanbol reasoners component provides a set of services that take advantage of automatic inference engines the module implements a common api for reasoning services providing the possibility to plug different reasoners and configurations in parallel actually the module includes owlapi and jena based abstract services with concrete implementations for jena rdfs owl owlmini and hermit reasoning service knowledge models services that are used to define and manipulate the data models eg ontologies that are used to store the semantic information the apache stanbol ontology manager provides a controlled environment for managing ontologies ontology networks and user sessions for semantic data modeled after them it provides full access to ontologies stored into the stanbol persistence layer managing an ontology network means that you can activate or deactivate parts of a complex model from time to time so that your data can be viewed and classified under different logical lenses this is especially useful in reasoning operations persistence services that store or cache semantic information ie enhanced content entities facts and make it searchable the apache stanbol contenthub is an apache solr based document repository which enables storage of textbased documents and customizable semantic search facilities the contenthub exposes an efficient java api together with the corresponding restful services
