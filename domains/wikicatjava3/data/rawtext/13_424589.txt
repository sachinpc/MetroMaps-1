using a wireless internet connection the skype wifi phone has an onscreen menu that lets skype users see who is online and available to talk similar to what is seen on a pc it can also be used to talk with nonskype users skypeout minutes can be used to call any phone for a low price and no monthly fee the skype wifi phone does not contain a web browser and so can not access hotspots that require webbased login or authentication third party licensing thirdparty developers such as truphone nimbuzz and fring previously allowed skype to run in parallel with several other competing voipim networks truphone and nimbuzz provide truphoneout and nimbuzzout as a competing paid service in any symbian or java environment nimbuzz made skype available to blackberry users and fring provided mobile video calling over skype as well as support for the android platform skype disabled fring users from accessing skype in july  nimbuzz discontinued support on request of skype in october  before and during the microsoft acquisition skype withdrew licensing from several third parties producing software and hardware compatible with skype the skype for asterisk product from digium was withdrawn as no longer available for sale the senao sn longrange km cordless phone was discontinued due to loss of licenses to participate in the skype network as peers in combination these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff protocol skype uses a proprietary internet telephony voip network called the skype protocol the protocol has not been made publicly available by skype and official applications using the protocol are closedsource part of the skype technology relies on the global index pp protocol belonging to the joltid ltd corporation the main difference between skype and standard voip clients is that skype operates on a peertopeer model originally based on the kazaa software rather than the more usual clientserver model note that the very popular session initiation protocol sip model of voip is also peertopeer but implementation generally requires registration with a server as does skype on june   microsoft announced the deprecation of the old skype protocol within several months from this date in order to continue using skype services skype users will have to update to skype applications released in  the new skype protocolmicrosoft notification protocol  the deprecation became effective in the second week of august  transferred files are now saved on central servers as far as networking stack support is concerned skype only supports the ipv protocol it lacks support for the nextgeneration internet protocol ipv protocol detection and control many networking and security companies claim to detect and control skypes protocol for enterprise and carrier applications while the specific detection methods used by these companies are often private pearsons chisquared test and naive bayes classification are two approaches that were published in  combining statistical measurements of payload properties such as byte frequencies and initial byte sequences as well as flow properties like packet sizes and packet directions has also shown to be an effective method for identifying skypes tcp and udpbased protocols audio codecs g and svopc skype added a skypecreated codec called silk to skype  for windows and other skype clients silk is intended to be lightweight and embeddable additionally skype has released opus as an opensource codec which integrates the silk codec principles for voice transmission with the celt codec principles for higherquality audio transmissions such as live music performances opus was submitted to the internet engineering task force ietf in september  since then it has been standardized as rfc  video codecs vp is used for versions prior to skype  as of version  h is used for both standard definition and p and p highdefinition group and oneonone video chat skype qik skype acquired the video service qik in  after shutting down qik in april  skype relaunched the service as skype qik on  october  although qik offered video conferencing and internet streaming the new service focuses on mobile video messaging between individuals and groups security and privacy skype was claimed initially to be a secure communication with one of its early web pages stating highly secure with endtoend encryption security services were invisible to the user and encryption cannot be disabled skype reportedly uses publicly documented widely trusted encryption techniques rsa for key negotiation and the advanced encryption standard to encrypt conversations however it is impossible to verify that these algorithms are used correctly completely and at all times as there is no public review possible without a protocol specification andor the app source code skype provides an uncontrolled registration system for users with no proof of identity instead a free choice of nicknames permits users to use the system without revealing their identities to other users it is trivial to set up an account using any name the displayed callers name is no guarantee of authenticity a thirdparty paper analyzing the security and methodology of skype was presented at black hat europe  it analyzed skype and found a number of security issues with the thencurrent security model skype incorporates some features which tend to hide its traffic but it is not specifically designed to thwart traffic analysis and therefore does not provide anonymous communication some researchers have been able to watermark the traffic so that it is identifiable even after passing through an anonymizing network in an interview kurt sauer the chief security officer of skype said we provide a safe communication option i will not tell you whether we can listen or not this does not deny the fact that the nsa monitors skype conversations skypes client uses an undocumented and proprietary protocol the free software foundation fsf is concerned about user privacy issues arising from using proprietary software and protocols and has made a replacement for skype one of their highpriority projects security researchers biondi and desclaux have speculated that skype may have a back door since skype sends traffic even when it is turned off and because skype has taken extreme measures to obfuscate their traffic and functioning of their app several media sources reported that at a meeting about the lawful interception of ip based services held on  june  highranking unnamed officials at the austrian interior ministry said that they could listen in on skype conversations without problems austrian public broadcasting service orf citing minutes from the meeting reported that the austrian police are able to listen in on skype connections skype declined to comment on the reports one easily demonstrated method of monitoring is to set up two computers with the same skype user id and password when a message is typed or a call is received on one computer the second computer duplicates the audio and text this requires knowledge of the user id and password the united states federal communications commission fcc has interpreted the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea as requiring digital phone networks to allow wiretapping if authorized by an fbi warrant in the same way as other phone services in february  skype said that not being a telephone company owning phone lines it is exempt from calea and similar laws which regulate us phone companies and in fact it is not clear whether skype could support wiretapping even if it wanted to according to the aclu the act is inconsistent with the original intent of the fourth amendment to the us constitution more recently the aclu has expressed the concern that the fcc interpretation of the act is incorrect it has been suggested that microsoft made changes to skypes infrastructure to ease various wiretapping requirements however skype denies the claims some time before skype was sold in  the company had started its own app called project chess to explore legal and technical ways to easily share calls with intelligence agencies and law enforcement on  february  the european unions eurojust agency announced that the italian desk at eurojust would play a key role in the coordination and cooperation of the investigations on the use of internet telephony systems voip such as skype  the purpose of eurojusts coordination role is to overcome the technical and judicial obstacles to the interception of internet telephony systems taking into account the various data protection rules and civil rights in november  a flaw was disclosed to skype that showed how hackers could secretly track any users ip address as of  this has still not been fixed in  skype introduced automatic updates to better protect users from security risks but received some challenge from users of the mac product as the updates cannot be disabled from version  on both on mac os and windows versions although in the latter and only from version  on automatic updating can be turned off in certain cases according to a  washington post article skype has expanded its cooperation with law enforcement authorities to make online chats and other user information available to police the article additionally mentions skype made changes to allow authorities access to addresses and credit card numbers in november  skype was reported to have handed over user data of a prowikileaks activist to dallas texasbased private security company isight partners without a warrant or court order the alleged handover would be a breach of skypes privacy policy skype responded with a statement that it launched an internal investigation to probe the breach of user data privacy  november  a russian user published a flaw in skypes security which allowed any person to take over a skype account knowing only the victims email by following  steps this vulnerability was claimed to exist for months and existed for more than  hours since published widely  may  it was documented that a url sent via a skype instant messaging session was usurped by the skype service and subsequently used in a http head query originating from an ip address registered to microsoft in redmond the ip address used was  the microsoft query used the full url supplied in the im conversation and was generated by a previously undocumented security service security experts speculate the action was triggered by a technology similar to microsofts smartscreen filter used in its browsers the  mass surveillance disclosures revealed that agencies such as the nsa and the fbi have the ability to eavesdrop on skype including the monitoring and storage of text and video calls and file transfers the prism surveillance program which requires fisa court authorization reportedly has allowed the nsa unfettered access to its data center supernodes according to the leaked documents integration work began in november  but it was not until february  that the company was served with a directive to comply signed by the attorney general with nsa documents showing that collection began on  march  on  november  skype scored  out of  points on the electronic frontier foundations secure messaging scorecard skype received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider doesnt have access to ie the communications are not endtoend encrypted users cant verify contacts identities past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen ie the service does not provide forward secrecy the code is not open to independent review ie the code is not opensource the security design is not properly documented and there has not been a recent independent security audit aim blackberry messenger ebuddy xms hushmail kik messenger viber and yahoo messenger also scored  out of  points service in the peoples republic of china since september  users in china trying to download the skype software client have been redirected to the site of tom online a joint venture between a chinese wireless operator and skype from which a modified chinese version can be downloaded the tom client participates in chinas system of internet censorship monitoring text messages between skype users in china as well as messages exchanged with users outside the country niklas zennstrm then chief executive of skype told reporters that tom had implemented a text filter which is what everyone else in that market is doing those are the regulations he also stated one thing thats certain is that those things are in no way jeopardising the privacy or the security of any of the users in october  it was reported that tom had been saving the full message contents of some skype text conversations on its servers apparently focusing on conversations containing political issues such as tibet falun gong taiwan independence and the chinese communist party the saved messages contain personally identifiable information about the message senders and recipients including ip addresses usernames landline phone numbers and the entire content of the text messages including the time and date of each message information about skype users outside china who were communicating with a tomskype user was also saved a server misconfiguration made these log files accessible to the public for a time research on the tomskype venture has revealed information about blacklisted keyword checks allowing censorship and surveillance of its users the partnership has received much criticism for the latter microsoft remains unavailable for comment on the issue according to reports from the advocacy group great fire microsoft has modified censorship restrictions and ensured encryption of all user information furthermore microsoft is now partnered with guangming founder gmf in china all attempts to visit the official skype web page from mainland china redirects to skypegmwcn the linux version of skype is unavailable no skype calls to india landline

us to persons who opted into the action skypes refund policy states that they will provide refunds in full if customers have used less than  euro of their skype credit upon a duly submitted request skype will refund you on a pro rata basis for the unused period of a product skype has come under some criticism from users for the inability to completely close accounts users not wanting to continue using skype can make their account inactive by deleting all personal information except for the username due to an outage happened on september   that affected several users in new zealand australia and other countries skype decided to compensate their customers with  minutes of free calls to over  landline and  mobile phone numbers educational use although skype is a commercial product its free version is being used with increasing frequency among teachers and schools interested in global education projects for example skype is being used to facilitate language exchange students in different
