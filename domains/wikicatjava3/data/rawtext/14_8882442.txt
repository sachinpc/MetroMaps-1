cegui crazy eddies gui cegui is a graphical user interface gui library for the programming language c it was designed for the needs of video games but is usable for nongame tasks such as applications and tools it is designed for user flexibility in lookandfeel and to be adaptable to the users choice in tools and operating systems configurability the strength of ceguis design is that it is highly configurable the system does not directly load files render windows directly display text or even fetch input from the system cegui interfaces with these through userdefined code though its source code package comes with a number of modules for using certain components and libraries this freedom allows using cegui in any kind of resource management system or operating environment input is expected to be gathered by the users code possibly filtered as the user sees fit and then passed to cegui for window processing cegui comes with a reasonable set of widgets comparable to those of the average widget toolkit tools cegui can be fully customized using standard image xml andor code editing tools however cegui also provides tools designed to aid in designing and developing cegui based interfaces older cegui versions before  provided separate tools to edit different aspects of the interface the most notable of those being the imageset and layout editors since cegui  there exists a new unified editing tool called cegui unified editor ceed which is being actively developed it incorporates all aspects of gui development into one tool rendering rendering is performed by a backend rendering module cegui provides modules for directd opengl the ogre d engine and the irrlicht engine other modules can be written for custom engines resource management file loading and resource management are handled through a backend resource provider module users can create custom modules to define how resources are accessed this allows the library to be used in virtually any operating environment the default resource provider is crossplatform and provides standard fileaccess mechanics for loading resources an optional minizip module enables resourceloading from ziparchives memory management cegui has a flexible memory management system this system was based on ogre and allows clients to map different types of allocators to different types of objects by default all objects use the operating systems default allocator cegui provides support for ogre and nedmalloc allocators scripting cegui has an optional backend scripting module lua and python scripting modules are provided by cegui the full cegui application programming interface api is available via script so that clients can create windows define relationships and handle events all within a scripted environment look and feel cegui has a powerful system for defining the look and feel of various widgets the system named falagard allows defining the look of a widget via xml files or c code if the user prefers it can also change the layout behavior of any widgets animation cegui has a builtin animation system this system allows many standard transitional effects from moving and resizing windows to color transforms and image sequencing animations can be defined in xml and triggered by any event the client can specify windowproperties as keyframes how to transition between frames and the transitiontime between frames unicode cegui is unicodeaware and has support for bidirectional languages via an optional backend bidi module this support is provided by minibidi or fribidi library dependencies cegui can be built with no dependencies to outside libraries however typical configurations require freetype a rendering module an xml parser module and an image codec module cegui already provides support for several external libraries thanks to its modular design
