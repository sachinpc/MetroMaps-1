globally executable mhp globally executable mhp gem is a dvb specification of a java based middleware for tv broadcast receivers iptv terminals and bluray players gem is an etsi standard  etsi ts   etsi ts    and an itu recommendation itut j gem defines a set of common functionalities which are independent from the signaling and protocols of a specific transmission network and enables to write interoperable java applications for tv gem is not intended to be directly implemented but rather forms the basis for broader specifications targeting a particular network infrastructure eg us cable or class of device eg bluray disc players gem defines profiles for different device classes targets  these define the set of available features of gem for this device class currently gem defines targets api profiles for broadcast packaged media bluray and iptv combinations of these targets can be combined into a hybrid gem platform which enables to build devices with multiple network interfaces such as a combined broadcastiptv settop box history a few years ago the dvb project started the development of a javabased application platform a set of apis called mhp intended to support software applications running on digital television platforms such applications could include electronic program guides epgs interactivity video on demand vod email through your television etc the mhp specification defines the download of mhp applications xlets over transmission networks based on other dvb specifications ie overtheair or terrestrial networks using dvbt satellite networks using dvbs cable networks using dvbc as other specification bodies such as cablelabs and the bluray disc association chose to base their own dtv software standards on mhp it became necessary to define a subset of mhp which removes the transmissionrelated elements of the mhp specification but retains the application apis thus allowing broad content compatibility across a range of delivery platforms recently the dvb project made gem the primary middleware specification and released a selfcontained version of gem in etsi ts   platforms at the time of writing the following platforms are defined which base onextend gem as all these platforms are based on the common gemcore making it possible to write java applications that will run interoperably on all these systems
