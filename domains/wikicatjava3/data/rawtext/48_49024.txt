wolfram mathematica wolfram mathematica sometimes referred to as mathematica is a symbolic mathematical computation program sometimes called a computer algebra program used in many scientific engineering mathematical and computing fields it was conceived by stephen wolfram and is developed by wolfram research of champaign illinois the wolfram language is the programming language used in mathematica features features of wolfram mathematica include interface wolfram mathematica is split into two parts the kernel and the front end the kernel interprets expressions wolfram language code and returns result expressions the front end designed by theodore gray in  provides a gui which allows the creation and editing of notebook documents containing program code with prettyprinting formatted text together with results including typeset mathematics graphics gui components tables and sounds all content and formatting can be generated algorithmically or edited interactively standard word processing capabilities are supported including realtime multilingual spellchecking documents can be structured using a hierarchy of cells which allow for outlining and sectioning of a document and support automatic numbering index creation documents can be presented in a slideshow environment for presentations notebooks and their contents are represented as mathematica expressions that can be created modified or analyzed by mathematica programs or converted to other formats the front end includes development tools such as a debugger input completion and automatic syntax coloring among the alternative front ends is the wolfram workbench an eclipse based ide introduced in  it provides projectbased code development tools for mathematica including revision management debugging profiling and testing there is a plugin for intellij idea based ides to work with wolfram language code which in addition to syntax highlighting can analyse and autocomplete local variables and defined functions the mathematica kernel also includes a command line front end other interfaces include jmath based on gnu readline and mash which runs selfcontained mathematica programs with arguments from the unix command line highperformance computing in recent years the capabilities for highperformance computing have been extended with the introduction of packed arrays version   and sparse matrices version   and by adopting the gnu multiprecision library to evaluate highprecision arithmetic version   added automatic multithreading when computations are performed on multicore computers this release included cpu specific optimized libraries in addition mathematica is supported by third party specialist acceleration hardware such as clearspeed in  gridmathematica was introduced to allow user level parallel programming on heterogeneous clusters and multiprocessor systems and in  parallel computing technology was included in all mathematica licenses including support for grid technology such as windows hpc server  microsoft compute cluster server and sun grid support for cuda and opencl gpu hardware was added in  also since version  it can generate c code which is automatically compiled by a system c compiler such as gcc or microsoft visual studio deployment there are several ways to deploy applications written in wolfram mathematica connections with other applications communication with other applications occurs through a protocol called wstp it allows communication between the wolfram mathematica kernel and frontend and also provides a general interface between the kernel and other applications wolfram research freely distributes a developer kit for linking applications written in the c programming language to the mathematica kernel through wstp using jlink a java program can ask mathematica to perform computations likewise a mathematica program can load java classes manipulate java objects and perform method calls similar functionality is achieved with net link but with net programs instead of java programs other languages that connect to mathematica include haskell applescript racket visual basic python and clojure links are available to many mathematical software packages including openofficeorg calc microsoft excel matlab r sagemath singular wolfram systemmodeler and origin mathematical equations can be exchanged with other computational or typesetting software via mathml communication with sql databases is achieved through builtin support for jdbc mathematica can also install web services from a wsdl description it can access hdfs data via hadoop mathematica can capture realtime data via a link to labview from financial data feeds and directly from hardware devices via gpib ieee  usb and serial interfaces it automatically detects and reads from hid devices computable data wolfram mathematica includes collections of curated data provided for use in computations mathematica is also integrated with wolfram alpha an online service which provides additional data some of which is kept updated in real time some of the data sets include astronomical chemical geopolitical language biomedical and weather data in addition to mathematical data such as knots and polyhedra version history wolfram mathematica built on the ideas in cole and wolframs earlier symbolic manipulation program smp the name of the program mathematica was suggested to stephen wolfram by apple cofounder steve jobs although stephen wolfram had thought about it earlier and rejected it wolfram research has released the following versions of mathematica wolfram research has published a series of handson starter webcasts that introduce the user interface and the engine
