adobe flash adobe flash formerly called macromedia flash and shockwave flash is a multimedia software platform for production of animations browser games rich internet applications desktop applications mobile applications and mobile games flash displays text vector graphics and raster graphics to provide animations video games and applications it allows streaming of audio and video and can capture mouse keyboard microphone and camera input artists may produce flash graphics and animations using adobe animate software developers may produce applications and video games using adobe flash builder flashdevelop flash catalyst or any text editor when used with the apache flex sdk endusers can view flash content via flash player for web browsers air for desktop or mobile apps or thirdparty players such as scaleform for video games adobe flash player supported on microsoft windows mac os x and linux enables endusers to view flash content using web browsers adobe flash lite enabled viewing flash content on older smartphones but has been discontinued and superseded by adobe air the actionscript programming language allows the development of interactive animations video games web applications desktop applications and mobile applications programmers can implement flash software using an ide such as adobe animate adobe flash builder flashdevelop and powerflasher fdt adobe air enables fullfeatured desktop and mobile applications to be developed with flash and published for microsoft windows mac os x google android and ios contentproviders frequently used to use flash to display streaming video advertising and interactive multimedia content on web pages and on flashenabled software however after the s the usage of flash on web sites declined applications websites in the early s flash was widely installed on desktop computers and was commonly used to display interactive web pages online games and to playback video and audio content in  youtube was founded by former paypal employees and it used flash player as a means to display compressed video content on the web between  and  numerous businesses used flashbased websites to launch new products or to create interactive company portals notable users include nike hewlettpackard nokia general electric world wildlife fund hbo cartoon network and disney after adobe introduced hardwareaccelerated d for flash staged flash websites saw a growth of d content for product demonstrations and virtual tours in  youtube offered videos in html format to support the iphone and ipad which did not support flash player after a controversy with apple adobe stopped developing flash player for mobile focussing its efforts on adobe air applications and html animation in  google introduced google swiffy to convert flash animation to html a tool google would use to automatically convert flash web ads for mobile devices in  youtube switched to html technology on all devices however it will preserve the flashbased video player for older web browsers rias after flash  introduced actionscript in  developers combined the visual and programming capabilities of flash to produce interactive experiences and applications for the web such webbased applications eventually came to be known as rich internet applications rias in  macromedia flex was released and specifically targeted the application development market flex introduced new user interface components advanced data visualization components data remoting and a modern ide flash builder flex competed with asynchronous javascript and xml ajax and microsoft silverlight during its tenure flex was upgraded to support integration with remote data sources using amf blazeds adobe livecycle amazon elastic compute cloud and others as of  flex applications can be published for desktop platforms using adobe air as of  web applications and rias can be developed with flash using the actionscript  programming language and related tools such as adobe flash builder thirdparty ides such as flashdevelop and powerflasher fdt also enable developers to create flash games and applications and are generally similar to microsoft visual studio flex applications are typically built using flex frameworks such as puremvc video games flash video games are popular on the internet with portals like newgrounds dedicated to hosting of flashbased games popular games developed with flash include angry birds clash of clans farmville adventurequest and machinarium adobe introduced various technologies to help build video games including adobe air to release games for desktop or mobile platforms adobe scout to improve performance crossbridge to convert cbased games to run in flash and staged to support gpuaccelerated video games d frameworks like awayd and flared simplified creation of d content for flash adobe air allows creation of flashbased mobile games which may be published to the google play and itunes app stores flash is also used to build interfaces and huds for d video games using scaleform gfx a technology that renders flash content within nonflash video games scaleform is supported by more than  major video game engines including unreal engine udk cryengine and phyreengine and has been used to provide d interfaces for more than  major video game titles since its launch in  film and animation adobe animate is one of the common animation programs for lowcost d television and commercial animation in competition with anime studio and toon boom animation notable users of flash include dhx media vancouver for productions including pound puppies and  fresh tv for total drama nelvana for teen and clone high williams street for metalocalypse and squidbillies nickelodeon animation studios for wow wow wubbzy  danny phantom happy tree friends and more flash is less commonly used for featurelength animated films however s the secret of kells an irish film was animated primarily in adobe flash and was nominated for an academy award for best animated feature at the nd academy awards several popular online series are currently produced in flash such as the emmy awardwinning offmikes produced by espn and animax entertainment gotham girls produced by warner brothers crime time produced by future thought productions and homestar runner produced by mike and matt chapman various thirdparty software packages designed for traditionally trained cartoonists and animators can publish animations in the swf format history futurewave the precursor to flash was a product named smartsketch published by futurewave software the company was founded by charlie jackson jonathan gay and michelle welsh smartsketch was a vector drawing application for pen computers running the penpoint os when penpoint failed in the marketplace smartsketch was ported to microsoft windows and mac os as the internet became more popular futurewave realized the potential for a vectorbased web animation tool that might challenge macromedia shockwave technology in  futurewave modified smartsketch by adding framebyframe animation features and released this new product as futuresplash animator on macintosh and pc futurewave approached adobe systems with an offer to sell them futuresplash in  but adobe turned down the offer at that time microsoft wanted to create an online tv network msn  and adopted futuresplash animated content as a central part of it disney online used futuresplash animations for their subscriptionbased service disneys daily blast fox broadcasting company launched the simpsons using futuresplash macromedia in november  futuresplash was acquired by macromedia and macromedia rebranded and released futuresplash animator as macromedia flash  flash was a twopart system a graphics and animation editor known as macromedia flash and a player known as macromedia flash player futuresplash animator was an animation tool originally developed for penbased computing devices but due to the small size of the futuresplash viewer it was particularly suited for download over the web macromedia distributed flash player as a free browser plugin in order to quickly gain market share as of  more computers worldwide had the flash player installed than any other web media format including java quicktime realnetworks and windows media player macromedia upgraded the flash system significantly from  to  adding movieclips actions the precursor to actionscript alpha transparency and other features as flash matured macromedias focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a web application platform adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint in  the first major version of actionscript was developed and released with flash  actionscript  was released with flash mx  and supported objectoriented programming improved ui components and other advanced programming features the last version of flash released by macromedia was flash  which focused on graphical upgrades such as filters blur drop shadow etc blend modes similar to adobe photoshop and advanced features for flv video adobe macromedia was acquired by adobe systems in  and the entire macromedia product line including flash dreamweaver directorshockwave and authorware is now handled by adobe in  adobe released adobe flash cs professional the first version released under adobe and the ninth major version of flash it introduced the actionscript  programming language which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with flash adobe flex builder built on eclipse targeted the enterprise application development market and was also released the same year flex builder included the flex sdk a set of components that included charting advanced ui and data services flex data services in  adobe released the historic tenth version of flash adobe flash cs flash  improved animation capabilities within the flash editor adding a motion editor panel similar to adobe after effects inverse kinematics bones basic d object animation objectbased animation and other advanced text and graphics features flash player  included the first inbuilt d engine without gpu acceleration that allowed basic object transformations in d space position rotation scaling also in  adobe released the first version of adobe integrated runtime later rebranded as adobe air a runtime engine that replaced flash player and provided additional capabilities to the actionscript  language to build desktop and mobile applications with air developers could access the file system files  folders and connected devices joystick gamepad sensors for the first time in  adobe flash player  was released and with it the first version of staged allowing for gpuaccelerated d rendering for flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as microsoft windows and mac os x adobe further improved d capabilities from  to  adding support for d rendering on android and ios platforms alphachannels compressed textures texture atlases and other features adobe air was upgraded to support bit computers and developers could now add additional functionality to the air runtime using air native extensions ane in  adobe air reached a milestone when over  unique applications were built on air and over  billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world may  adobe air was voted as the best mobile application development product at the consumer electronics show for two consecutive years ces  and ces  format fla flash source files are in the fla format and contain graphics and animation as well as embedded assets such as bitmap images audio files and flv video files the flash source file format is a proprietary format and adobe animate is the only available authoring tool capable of editing such files flash source files fla may be compiled into flash movie files swf using adobe animate note that fla files can be edited but output swf files cannot swf flash movie files are in the swf format traditionally called shockwave flash movies flash movies or flash applications usually have a swf file extension and may be used in the form of a web page plugin strictly played in a standalone flash player or incorporated into a selfexecuting projector movie with the exe extension in microsoft windows flash video files have a flv file extension and are either used from within swf files or played through a flvaware player such as vlc or quicktime and windows media player with external codecs added the use of vector graphics combined with program code allows flash files to be smallerand thus allows streams to use less bandwidththan the corresponding bitmaps or video clips for content in a single format such as just text video or audio other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less cpu power than the corresponding flash movie for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades in addition to a vectorrendering engine the flash player includes a virtual machine called the actionscript virtual machine avm for scripting interactivity at runtime with video mpbased audio and bitmap graphics as of flash player  it offers two video codecs on technologies vp and sorenson spark and runtime jpeg progressive jpeg png and gif capability in the next version flash is slated to use a justintime compiler for the actionscript engine d flash player  introduced a full d shader api called staged which is fairly similar to webgl staged enables gpuaccelerated rendering of d graphics within flash games and applications and has been used to build angry birds and a couple of other notable games various d frameworks have been built for flash using staged such as awayd  coppercube flared starling professional game engines like unreal engine and unity also export flash versions which use staged to render d graphics flash video virtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and crossplatform including adobes offering of flash video which was first introduced with flash version  flash video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of flash in  apple publicly criticized adobe flash including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration one reason flash is not to be found on apples mobile devices soon after apples criticism adobe demoed and released a beta version of flash  which takes advantage of gpu hardware acceleration even on a mac flash  beta released december  adds hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline flash player supports two distinct modes of video playback and hardware accelerated video decoding may not be used for older video content such content causes excessive cpu usage compared to comparable content played with other players in tests done by ars technica in  and  adobe flash player performed better on windows than mac os x and linux with the same hardware performance has later improved for the latter two on mac os x with flash player  and on linux with flash player  flash audio flash audio is most commonly encoded in mp or aac advanced audio coding however it can also use adpcm nellymoser nellymoser asao codec and speex audio codecs flash allows sample rates of   and khz it cannot have khz audio sample rate which is the standard tv and dvd sample rate on august   adobe announced on its blog that with update  of flash player  flash video will also implement some parts of the mpeg international standards specifically flash player will work with video compressed in h mpeg part  audio compressed using aac mpeg part  the fv mp mpeg part  mv ma gp and mov multimedia container formats gpp timed text specification mpeg part  which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing capability for the ilst atom which is the id equivalent itunes uses to store metadata mpeg part  and h will not work in fv file format adobe also announced that it will be gradually moving away from the flv format to the standard iso base media file format mpeg part  owing to functional limits with the flv structure when streaming h the final release of the flash player implementing some parts of mpeg standards had become available in fall  adobe flash player  does not have acoustic echo cancellation unlike the voip offerings of skype and google voice making this and earlier versions of flash less suitable for group calling or meetings flash player  beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation scripting language actionscript is the programming language used by flash it is an enhanced superset of the ecmascript programming language with a classical javastyle class model rather than javascripts prototype model specifications in october  macromedia disclosed the flash version  specification on its website it did this in response to many new and often semiopen formats competing with swf such as xaras flare and sharps extended vector animation formats several developers quickly created a c library for producing swf in february  morphink  was introduced the first thirdparty program to create swf files macromedia also hired middlesoft to create a freely available developers kit for the swf file format versions  to  macromedia made the flash files specifications for versions  and later available only under a nondisclosure agreement but they are widely available from various sites in april  the flash swf file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format flash  although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats on sorenson spark etc this new documentation covered all the new features offered in flash v including new actionscript commands expressive filter controls and so on the file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the flash file format the license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of flash files the flash  specification was made available under similar restrictions in june  adobe launched the open screen project adobe link which made the swf specification available without restrictions previously developers could not use the specification for making swfcompatible players but only for making swfexporting authoring software the specification still omits information on codecs such as sorenson spark however animation tools official tools the adobe animate authoring program is primarily used to design graphics and animation and publish the same for websites web applications and video games the program also offers limited support for audio and video embedding and actionscript scripting adobe released adobe livemotion designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats including swf livemotion failed to gain any notable user base in february  macromedia purchased presedia which had developed a flash authoring tool that automatically converted powerpoint files into flash macromedia subsequently released the new product as breeze which included many new enhancements thirdparty tools various free and commercial software packages can output animations into the flash swf format suitable for display on the web including the flash  linux project was an initiative to develop an open source linux application as an alternative to adobe animate development plans included authoring capacity for d animation and tweening as well as outputing swf file formats fl evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring d animation and publishing of swf files flash  linux was renamed uira uira intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the fl project and the qflash project both of which were open source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary adobe flash programming tools official tools adobe provides a series of tools to develop software applications and video games for flash thirdparty tools thirdparty development tools have been created to assist developers in creating software applications and video games with flash players commercial adobe flash player is the multimedia and application player originally developed by macromedia and acquired by adobe systems it plays swf files which can be created by adobe animate apache flex or a number of other adobe systems and rd party tools it has support for a scripting language called actionscript which can be used to display flash video from an swf file scaleform gfx is a commercial alternative flash player that features fully hardwareaccelerated d graphics rendering using the gpu scaleform has high conformance with both flash  actionscript  and flash  actionscript  scaleform gfx is a game development middleware solution that helps create graphical user interfaces or huds within d video games it does not work with web browsers irfanview an image viewer uses flash player to display swf files open source lightspark is a free and open source swf player that supports most of actionscript  and has a mozillacompatible plugin it will fall back on gnash a free swf player supporting actionscript  and  avm code lightspark supports openglbased rendering for d content the player is also compatible with h flash videos on youtube gnash aimed to create a software player and browser plugin replacement for the adobe flash player gnash can play swf files up to version  and  of actionscript  gnash run on windows linux and other platforms for the bit bit and other operating systems but the project was terminated in february  shumway was an open source flash player released by mozilla in november  it was built in javascript and is thus compatible with modern webbrowsers in early october  shumway was included by default in the firefox nightly branch shumway rendered flash contents by translating contents inside flash files to html elements and running an actionscript interpreter in javascript it supported both avm and avm and actionscript versions   and  development of shumway ceased in early  adobe flash player cannot ship as part of a pure open source or completely free operating system as its distribution is bound to the macromedia licensing program and subject to proposition first from adobe availability desktop computers flash player the latest version of adobe flash player is available for three major desktop platforms including windows macos and linux on linux only the ppapi plugin is still updated while the npapi version is not adobe flash player is available in four flavors the activex version is an activex control for use in internet explorer and any other windows applications that supports activex technology the plugin versions are available for browsers supporting either npapi or ppapi plugins on microsoft windows macos and linux the projector version is a standalone player that can open swf files directly the following table documents flash player and adobe air support on desktop operating systems adobe air the latest version of adobe air version  contains adobe flash player  and is available for windows xp and later as well as os x official support for desktop linux distributions ceased in june  with version  mobile devices flash player adobe flash player was available for a variety of mobile operating systems including android between versions  and  pocket pcwindows ce qnx eg on blackberry playbook symbian palm os and webos since version  flash player for smart phones was made available to handset manufacturers at the end of  however in november  adobe announced the withdrawal of support for flash player on mobile devices adobe continues to support deploying flashbased content as mobile applications via adobe air adobe is reaffirming its commitment to aggressively contribute to html adobe announced the end of flash for mobile platforms or tv instead focusing on html for browser content and adobe air for the various mobile application stores and described it as the beginning of the end blackberry ltd formerly known as rim announced that it would continue to develop flash player for the playbook there is no adobe flash player for ios devices iphone ipad and ipod touch however flash content can be made to run on ios devices in a variety of ways the mobile version of internet explorer for windows phone cannot play flash content however flash support is still present on the tablet version of windows adobe air adobe air was released in  and allows the creation of mobile applications and mobile games using flash and actionscript notable mobile games built with flash include angry birds machinarium and defend your castle using air developers can access the full adobe flash functionality including text vector graphics raster graphics video audio camera and microphone capability adobe air also includes additional features such as file system integration native client extensions desktop integration and access to connected devices and sensors air applications can be published as native phone applications on certain mobile operating systems such as android arm cortexa and above and apple ios the following table explains to what extent adobe air can run on various mobile operating systems portable electronic devices adobe flash lite is a lightweight version of adobe flash player intended for mobile phones and other portable electronic devices like chumby and iriver on the emerging singleboard enthusiast market as substantially popularized by the raspberry pi support from adobe is lacking however the opensource player gnash has been ported and found to be useful open screen project on may   adobe announced the open screen project with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers mobile devices and consumer electronics when the project was announced seven goals were outlined the abolition of licensing fees for adobe flash player and adobe integrated runtime the removal of restrictions on the use of the shockwave flash swf and flash video flv file formats the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting flash to new devices and the publishing of the flash cast protocol and action message format amf which let flash applications receive information from remote databases  the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of swf and flvfv specs have been published the flash cast protocolnow known as the mobile content delivery protocoland amf protocols have also been made available with amf available as an open source implementation blazeds the list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes palm motorola and nokia who together with adobe have announced a  million open screen project fund  the open screen project is no longer accepting new applications according to partner bsquare however paid licensing is still an option for device makers who want to use adobe software mobile support websites built with adobe flash will not function on most modern mobile devices running google android or ios iphone ipad the only alternative is using html and responsive web design to build websites that support both desktop and mobile devices however flash is still actively used to build mobile games using adobe air such games will not work in mobile web browsers but must be installed via the appropriate app store alternatives html html is often cited as an alternative to adobe flash technology usage on web pages adobe released a tool that converts flash to html and in june  google released an experimental tool that does the same in january  youtube defaulted to html players to better support more devices criticisms vendor dependence the reliance on adobe for decoding flash makes its use on the world wide web a concernthe completeness of its public specifications are debated and no complete implementation of flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse generally public specifications are what makes a format reimplementable see future proofing data storage and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator adobes restrictions on the use of the swfflv specifications were lifted in february  see adobes open screen project however despite efforts of projects like gnash swfdec and lightspark a complete free flash player is yet to be seen as of september  for example gnash cannot use swf v yet notably gnash has been a longstanding high priority project of the free software foundation since at least  and it was ranked number one in september  notable advocates of free software open standards and the world wide web have warned against the use of flash founder of mozilla europe tristan nitot stated in  companies building websites should beware of proprietary richmedia technologies like adobes flash and microsofts silverlight  youre producing content for your users and theres someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content representing open standards inventor of css and coauthor of html hkon wium lie explained in a google tech talk of  entitled the element the proposal of theora as the format for html video i believe very strongly that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if the video element is going to succeed flash is today the baseline format on the web the problem with flash is that its not an open standard representing the free software movement richard stallman stated in a speech in  that the use of flash in websites is a major problem for our community accessibility usability consultant jakob nielsen published an alertbox in  entitled flash  bad stating that flash tends to degrade websites for three reasons it encourages design abuse it breaks with the webs fundamental interaction principles and it distracts attention from the sites core value some problems have been at least partially fixed since nielsens complaints text size can be controlled using full page zoom and it has been possible for authors to include alternative text in flash since flash player  flash blocking in web browsers flash content is usually embedded using the codice or codice html element a web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text if supplied by the web page often a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements though some users cannot or will not install it since flash can be used to produce content such as advertisements that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download some web browsers default to not play flash content before the user clicks on it eg konqueror kmeleon most current browsers have a feature to block plugins playing one only when the user clicks it opera versions since  feature native flash blocking opera turbo requires the user to click to play flash content and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently both chrome and firefox have an option to enable click to play plugins equivalent flash blocker extensions are also available for many popular browsers firefox has flashblock and noscript internet explorer has foxie which contains a number of features one of them named flashblock webkitbased browsers under mac os x such as apples safari have clicktoflash firefox from version  rewrites old flashonly youtube embed code into youtubes modern embedded player that is capable of using either html or flash such embed code is used by nonyoutube sites to embed youtubes videos and can still be encountered for example on old blogs and forums security for many years adobe flash players security record has led many security experts to recommend against installing the player or to block flash content the uscert has recommended blocking flash and security researcher charlie miller recommended not to install flash however for people still using flash intego recommended that users get trusted updates only directly from the vendor that publishes them as of february   adobe flash player has over  cve entries of which over  lead to arbitrary code execution and past vulnerabilities have enabled spying via web cameras security experts have long predicted the demise of flash saying that with the rise of html the need for browser plugins such as flash is diminishing yet a significant proportion of websites still use it active moves by thirdparties to limit the risk began with steve jobs in  saying that apple would not allow flash on the iphone ipod touch and ipad  citing abysmal security as one reason in july  a series of newly discovered vulnerabilities resulted in facebooks chief security officer alex stamos issuing a call to adobe to discontinue the software entirely and the mozilla firefox web browser google chrome and apple safari to blacklist all earlier versions of flash player flash cookies like the http cookie a flash cookie also known as a local shared object can be used to save application data flash cookies are not shared across domains an august  study by the ashkan soltani and a team of researchers at uc berkeley found that  of websites using flash were also employing flash cookies yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking most browsers cache and history suppress or delete functions did not affect flash players writing local shared objects to its own cache in version  and earlier at which point the user community was much less aware of the existence and function of flash cookies than http cookies thus users with those versions having deleted http cookies and purged browser history files and caches may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact flash browsing history remains adobes own flash website storage settings panel a submenu of adobes flash settings manager web application and other editors and toolkits can manage settings for and delete flash local shared objects
