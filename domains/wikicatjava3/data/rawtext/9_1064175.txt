c c is an objectoriented dataparallel superset of ansi c with synchronous semantics it was developed in  as an alternative language to lisp and cmfortran for the connection machine cm and above the language c adds to c a domain data type and a selection statement for parallel execution in domains for the cm models the c compiler translated the code into serial c calling paris parallel instruction set functions and passed the resulting code to the front end computers native compiler the resulting executables were executed on the front end computer with paris calls being executed on the connection machine on the cm and cme parallel c code was executed in a simd style fashion on processing elements whereas serial code was executed on the pm partition manager node with the pm acting as a front end if directly compared to a cm the latest version of c as of  august  is x an unimplemented language called parallel c influenced the design of c dataparallelc was based on c
