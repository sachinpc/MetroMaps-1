mysql mysql officially pronounced as my sql is an opensource relational database management system rdbms its name is a combination of my the name of cofounder michael widenius daughter and sql the abbreviation for structured query language the mysql development project has made its source code available under the terms of the gnu general public license as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements mysql was owned and sponsored by a single forprofit firm the swedish company mysql ab now owned by oracle corporation for proprietary use several paid editions are available and offer additional functionality mysql is a central component of the lamp opensource web application software stack and other amp stacks lamp is an acronym for linux apache mysql perlphppython applications that use the mysql database include typo modx joomla wordpress phpbb mybb and drupal mysql is also used in many highprofile largescale websites including google though not for searches facebook twitter flickr and youtube overview mysql is written in c and c its sql parser is written in yacc but it uses a homebrewed lexical analyzer mysql works on many system platforms including aix bsdi freebsd hpux ecomstation ios irix linux os x microsoft windows netbsd novell netware openbsd opensolaris os warp qnx oracle solaris symbian sunos sco openserver sco unixware sanos and tru a port of mysql to openvms also exists the mysql server software itself and the client libraries use duallicensing distribution they are offered under gpl version  beginning from  june  which in  has been extended with a floss license exception or to use a proprietary license support can be obtained from the official manual free support additionally is available in different irc channels and forums oracle offers paid support via its mysql enterprise products they differ in the scope of services and in price additionally a number of third party organisations exist to provide support and services including mariadb and percona mysql has received positive reviews and reviewers noticed it performs extremely well in the average case and that the developer interfaces are there and the documentation not to mention feedback in the real world via web sites and the like is very very good it has also been tested to be a fast stable and true multiuser multithreaded sql database server history mysql was created by a swedish company mysql ab founded by david axmark allan larsson and michael monty widenius original development of mysql by widenius and axmark began in  the first version of mysql appeared on  may  it was initially created for personal usage from msql based on the lowlevel language isam which the creators considered too slow and inflexible they created a new sql interface while keeping the same api as msql by keeping the api consistent with the msql system many developers were able to use mysql instead of the proprietarily licensed msql antecedent milestones additional milestones in mysql development included legal disputes and acquisitions on  june  nusphere sued mysql ab tcx datakonsult ab and its original authors michael monty widenius and david axmark in us district court in boston for breach of contract tortious interference with third party contracts and relationships and unfair competition in  mysql ab sued progress nusphere for copyright and trademark infringement in united states district court nusphere had allegedly violated mysqls copyright by linking mysqls gpled code with nusphere gemini table without being in compliance with the license after a preliminary hearing before judge patti saris on  february  the parties entered settlement talks and eventually settled after the hearing fsf commented that judge saris made clear that she sees the gnu gpl to be an enforceable and binding license in october  oracle corporation acquired innobase oy the finnish company that developed the thirdparty innodb storage engine that allows mysql to provide such functionality as transactions and foreign keys after the acquisition an oracle press release mentioned that the contracts that make the companys software available to mysql ab would be due for renewal and presumably renegotiation some time in  during the mysql users conference in april  mysql issued a press release that confirmed that mysql and innobase oy agreed to a multiyear extension of their licensing agreement in february  oracle corporation acquired sleepycat software makers of the berkeley db a database engine providing the basis for another mysql storage engine this had little effect as berkeley db was not widely used and was dropped due to lack of use in mysql  a prega release of mysql  released in october  in january  sun microsystems bought mysql for  billion in april  oracle corporation entered into an agreement to purchase sun microsystems then owners of mysql copyright and trademark suns board of directors unanimously approved the deal it was also approved by suns shareholders and by the us government on  august  on  december  oracle pledged to continue to enhance mysql as it had done for the previous four years a movement against oracles acquisition of mysql to save mysql from oracle was started by one of the mysql founders monty widenius the petition of  developers and users called upon the european commission to block approval of the acquisition at the same time several free software opinion leaders including eben moglen pamela jones of groklaw jan wildeboer and carlo piana who also acted as cocounsel in the merger regulation procedure advocated for the unconditional approval of the merger as part of the negotiations with the european commission oracle committed that mysql server will continue until at least  to use the duallicensing strategy long used by mysql ab with proprietary and gpl versions available the antitrust of the eu had been pressuring it to divest mysql as a condition for approval of the merger but as revealed by wikileaks the us department of justice and antitrust at the request of oracle pressured the eu to approve the merger unconditionally the european commission eventually unconditionally approved oracles acquisition of mysql on  january  in january  prior to oracles acquisition of mysql monty widenius started a gplonly fork mariadb mariadb is based on the same code base as mysql server  and aims to maintain compatibility with oracleprovided versions features mysql is offered under two different editions the open source mysql community server and the proprietary enterprise server mysql enterprise server is differentiated by a series of proprietary extensions which install as server plugins but otherwise shares the version numbering system and is built from the same code base major features as available in mysql  the developers release minor updates of the mysql server approximately every two months the sources can be obtained from mysqls website or from mysqls github repository both under the gpl license limitations when using some storage engines other than the default of innodb mysql does not comply with the full sql standard for some of the implemented functionality including foreign key references and check constraints up until mysql  triggers are limited to one per action  timing meaning that at most one trigger can be defined to be executed after an insert operation and one before insert on the same table no triggers can be defined on views mysql databases inbuilt functions like unixtimestamp will return  after  utc on  january  deployment mysql can be built and installed manually from source code but it is more commonly installed from a binary package unless special customizations are required on most linux distributions the package management system can download and install mysql with minimal effort though further configuration is often required to adjust security and optimization settings though mysql began as a lowend alternative to more powerful proprietary databases it has gradually evolved to support higherscale needs as well it is still most commonly used in small to medium scale singleserver deployments either as a component in a lampbased web application or as a standalone database server much of mysqls appeal originates in its relative simplicity and ease of use which is enabled by an ecosystem of open source tools such as phpmyadmin in the medium range mysql can be scaled by deploying it on more powerful hardware such as a multiprocessor server with gigabytes of memory there are however limits to how far performance can scale on a single server scaling up so on larger scales multiserver mysql scaling out deployments are required to provide improved performance and reliability a typical highend configuration can include a powerful master database which handles data write operations and is replicated to multiple slaves that handle all read operations the master server continually pushes binlog events to connected slaves so in the event of failure a slave can be promoted to become the new master minimizing downtime further improvements in performance can be achieved by caching the results from database queries in memory using memcached or breaking down a database into smaller chunks called shards which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters backup software is a logical backup tool included with both community and enterprise editions of mysql it supports backing up from all storage engines mysql enterprise backup is a hot backup utility included as part of the mysql enterprise subscription from oracle offering native innodb hot backup as well as backup for other storage engines high availability software mysql fabric is an integrated system for managing a collection of mysql servers and a framework on top of which high availability and database sharding is built mysql fabric is opensource and supports procedure execution in the presence of failure providing an execution model usually called resilient execution mysql client libraries are extended so they are hiding the complexities of handling failover in the event of a server failure as well as correctly dispatching transactions to the shards cloud deployment mysql can also be run on cloud computing platforms such as amazon ec some common deployment models for mysql on the cloud are user interfaces graphical user interfaces a graphical user interface gui is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices or programs through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation as opposed to textbased interfaces typed command labels or text navigation guis are easier to learn than commandline interfaces clis which require commands to be typed on the keyboard thirdparty proprietary and free graphical administration applications or front ends are available that integrate with mysql and enable users to work with database structure and data visually some wellknown front ends are commandline interfaces a commandline interface is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program by typing in successive lines of text command lines mysql ships with many command line tools from which the main interface is the client mysql utilities is a set of utilities designed to perform common maintenance and administrative tasks originally included as part of the mysql workbench the utilities are a standalone download available from oracle percona toolkit is a crossplatform toolkit for mysql developed in perl percona toolkit can be used to prove replication is working correctly fix corrupted data automate repetitive tasks and speed up servers percona toolkit is included with several linux distributions such as centos and debian and packages are available for fedora and ubuntu as well percona toolkit was originally developed as maatkit but as of late  maatkit is no longer developed application programming interfaces many programming languages with languagespecific apis include libraries for accessing mysql databases these include mysql connectornet for integration with microsofts visual studio languages such as c and vb are most commonly used and the jdbc driver for java in addition an odbc interface called mysql connectorodbc allows additional programming languages that support the odbc interface to communicate with a mysql database such as asp or coldfusion the htsql urlbased query method also ships with a mysql adapter allowing direct interaction between a mysql database and any web client via structured urls project forks in software engineering a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it creating a distinct and separate piece of software a new thirdparty version the term often implies not merely creating a development branch but also a split in the developer community a form of schism mysql forks include the following
