provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all gmail users users may tune the system to allow mail marked as spam to be handled in particular ways google inc claims that mail sent to or from gmail is never read by a human being other than the account holder and content that is read by computers is only used to improve the relevance of advertisements and block spam emails the privacy policies of other popular email services like outlookcom and yahoo allow users personal information to be collected and utilized for advertising purposes gmail mobile gmail

even if they dont have each others email addresses google voice in gmail chat in august  google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within gmails google chat interface this service initially lacked an official name with google referring to it as google voice in gmail chat and also call phones in gmail but is now called google video and voice chat the service allows people to make free calls from their gmail account to us and canada at least through the end of  gmail account users can also call other countries on a fee basis the service logged over  million calls

from google calendar and google sites it can also make web searches via google search on may   gmail improved the search functionality to include autocomplete predictions from the users emails as with a web search gmails search functionality does not support searching for word fragments also known as substring search although it does perform partialstring stemming eg searching for month will turn up an email that includes the term months language input as of october  gmail supports handwriting input for  languages after google introduced the transliteration input method editor ime and virtual keyboard input tools to gmails settings the update allows gmail users to switch between over  virtual keyboards and transliterations that support languages such as hebrew thai and arabic on august   gmail became the first major email provider to let users send and receive email from addresses with accent marks and letters from outside the latin alphabet money transfer and payment options at the google io  conference held on may   google announced a feature that allows gmail users to send money as email attachments via google wallet google then explained in a blog post google wallet is now integrated with gmail so you can quickly and securely send money to friends and family directly within gmail  even if they dont have a gmail address its free to send money if your bank account is linked to google wallet or using your google wallet balance and low fees apply to send money using your linked credit or debit card google planned to roll out the feature over the coming months following the announcement prior to the launch of the email attachment feature the corporations plan to introduce a physical google wallet card was publicized in  but the project was abandoned due to logistical problems and following the departure of the head of the wallet team in early may  following the google io announcement google then reintroduced the card product in the us on november   as a debit card for wallet accounts the initial concept was a unifying card that could represent all of the users credit cardsthe digital trends website described it as essentially a standard debit card that you can use to pay with things using your google balance as of december  the card was free to obtain and the shipping period was around  days security at one time gmail used an unencrypted connection to retrieve user data encrypting only the connection used for the login page however by replacing the url httpmailgooglecommail with httpsmailgooglecommail users were able to force gmail to use a secure connection reducing the risk of thirdparty eavesdropping on user information such as emails and contacts which are transmitted in plaintext as javascript data in the page source code starting in july  it was possible to configure gmail for https access only through the settings  this prevented any insecure access via http pop and imap access uses transport layer security or tls at present gmail now defaults to a secure https connection although email clients such as mozilla thunderbird use tls when sending email it is not used when the email is sent from the gmail servers to the destination domains mail exchangers unless supported so at some stage the users email message may still be transmitted in unencrypted plain text on march   google announced the implementation of an enhancement of the overall security of gmail in response to the edward snowden privacy revelations in  an encrypted https connection will be used for the sending and receipt of all gmail emails and every single email message you send or receive of themis encrypted while moving internally through the corporations systems around  gmail had severe security issues which allowed a full account compromise via crosssite scripting vulnerabilities affecting the googlecom homepage or information disclosure through a file which was stored on googles server and included all the email contacts of the currently logged in user the vulnerability was quickly patched after the initial disclosure on the internet gmail offers spam filtering the system automatically deletes messages marked as spam after  days users can disable the spamfiltering system by creating a rule to make all messages skip the spam filter pop users can only check the spam folder manually via the web interface as only emails sent to the inbox can be retrieved via pop this is a technical limitation of pop in  about  of email sent to gmail accounts was filtered as spam ip addresses of webmail gmail users are disguised in order to protect security an early decision by paul buchheit gmail automatically scans all incoming and outgoing emails for viruses in email attachments if a virus is found on an attachment the reader is trying to open gmail will try to remove the virus and open the cleaned attachment gmail also scans all outgoing attachments and will prevent the message from being sent if a virus is found gmail also does not allow users to send or receive executable files or archives containing executable files on june   a new security feature was introduced to protect users from statesponsored attacks whenever google analysis indicate that a government has attempted to compromise an account gmail will display a notice that reads warning we believe statesponsored attackers may be trying to compromise your account or computer google may terminate a gmail account after nine months of inactivity as of  other webmail services have different often shorter times for marking an account as inactive yahoo mail deactivates dormant accounts after twelve months google releases data on link encryption in  google began to include gmail transport encryption rates by domain in the safer email section of its transparency reports step verification gmail supports step verification which is a form of two factor authentication once enabled users are required to verify their identity using a second method after entering their username and password when logging in on a new computer usually users enter a digit code sent to their phones through a text message or voice call users may also set up a compatible mobile app such as google authenticator to generate codes for them even when they do not have cell service on october   google announced the integration of universal second factor uf into the chrome browser which allowed the use of a physical security key for twostep verification users can choose uf security key as their primary method of step verification instead of having to rely on verification codes sent by sms or generated on their phones compared to digit codes security key offers better protection against phishing and eliminates the need for a mobile device hour lockdowns if an algorithm detects what google calls abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and  hours depending on the type of activity detected listed reasons for a lockdown include child pornography on gmail google combats child pornography through gmails servers in conjunction with the national center for missing  exploited children ncmec to find children suffering abuse around the world in collaboration with the ncmec google creates a database of child pornography pictures each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash google then scans gmail looking for the unique hashes when suspicious images are located google reports to the authorities interface the gmail user interface initially differed from other webmail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page an approach that was later copied by its competitors gmails user interface designer kevin fox intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page rather than having to navigate to other places gmails interface also makes use of labels tags  that replace the conventional folders and provide a more flexible methods of organizing email filters for automatically organizing deleting or forwarding incoming emails to other addresses and importance makers for automatically marking messages as important history the idea for gmail was developed by paul buchheit several years before it was announced to the public the project was known by the code name caribou initially the email client was available for use only by google employees internally gmail was announced to the public by google on april   as a limited beta release and was made publicly available on february   gmail exited from the beta status on july    gmails canonical uri changed from httpgmailgooglecomgmail to httpmailgooglecommail starting in december  those who typed in the former uri were redirected to the latter gmail added imap support on october   code changes gmails interface was rewritten in the middle of  and released to users starting on october   the new version had a redesigned contacts section quick contacts box and chat popups which were added to names in the message list as well as the contact list the contacts application is integrated into other google services such as google docs users granted access to the new version were given a link at the topright corner which read newer version since december  most new registrations in english us and most existing accounts have been given the new interface by default when supported these coding changes mean that only users of internet explorer  firefox  google chrome and safari  or more recent versions are supported by gmail and can fully use the new code opera  and more recent versions are not officially tested but are expected to work with all of gmails features internet explorer  netscape  mozilla  firefox  safari  and some other browsers will give limited functionality other browsers may be redirected to the basichtmlonly version of gmail during the week of january   google released an update that changed the way gmail loads javascript this caused the failure of some thirdparty extensions on november   google rolled out another redesign of its interface that simplified the look of gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall design change users were able to preview the new interface design and betatest for months prior to the official release as well as revert to the old interface until  march  when google discontinued the ability to revert on  september  google announced that it would discontinue internet explorer  support for gmail and other google apps on november   a few weeks after the launch of internet explorer  gmail was one of the first google projects to begin using closure library part of closure tools which were later open sourced much of the core library was developed concurrently with the  update browser support desktop gmails basic html version will work on almost all browsers the modern ajax version is officially supported in the current and prior major releases of google chrome mozilla firefox internet explorer and safari on a rolling basis over the years many officially unsupported browsers were able to use the ajax interface using user agent spoofing or url manipulation to trick gmail into providing them with the ajax version of the site however as the gmail interface has become more advanced it has become much harder to find alternatives that fully support the sites features mobile gmail has native applications for apples ios devices including iphone ipad and ipod touch and for googles android devices all other devices must use the gmail mobile web interface or a different email technology such as pop or imap to access gmail on mobile browsers the browser must be xhtml compliant have a url length of  bytes and allow redirects of  besides the network must allow cookies and secure ssl traffic a number of third party client applications for gmail on mobile devices are available from the app store and google play store in  google launched inbox an email application developed by the gmail team version  of gmail for android released in november  added support for sending and receiving email from nongmail addresses including yahoo mail and outlookcom through pop or imap language support the gmail interface supports  languages which include most of the us english features including arabic bulgarian catalan chinese

filipino tamil telugu thai turkish ukrainian urdu vietnamese welsh and zulu applications google has developed several subsidiary applications for gmail gmail notifier was an official tool offered by google which displayed a small icon in the notification area see taskbar in microsoft windows and on the righthand side of the menu bar in mac os x indicating the presence of new mail in the users inbox it also permitted gmail to be designated as the default mailclient for mailto links linux users had a choice of several unofficial notifiers as of  january  google discontinued the notifier on  november  google began offering a mobileapplication version of gmail for mobile phones capable of running java applications in addition sprint nextel announced separately that it would make the application available from its vision and power vision homepages and which it will preload onto some new sprint phones the application gives gmail its own custom menu system one much easier to navigate than a webbased application running on a cell phone gmails message threading also shows up clearly and the site displays attachments such as photos and documents in the application on august   google introduced gmail offline an html powered app based on the gmail app for tablets for providing access to the service while offline gmail offline runs on the google chrome browser and can be downloaded from the chrome web store on may   google engineer sundar pichai had revealed that google had internally been using the offline versions of gmail google calendar and google docs for months and that they would be made available to users in the summer of  in november  version  of the android app was released providing access to other email services besides gmail and including those that use pop google apps provider branding on  february  google introduced gmail for your domain all companies who participated in the beta testing gained permission to use gmail throughout their own domains since then google has developed google apps which include customizable versions of gmail google calendar google sites and more with various editions available it targets enterprises as well as small businesses google apps partner edition a nowdiscontinued service targeted at isps and portals provided brandcustomizable gmail accounts along with other google services such as calendar and docs reception awards gmail was ranked second in pc worlds  best products of  behind mozilla firefox gmail also won honorable mention in the bottom line design awards  in september  forbes magazine declared gmail to be the best webmail application for small businesses in november  gmail received pc worlds  star rating competition after gmails initial development and launch many existing web mail services quickly increased their storage capacity for example hotmail increased space for some users from  mb to  mb with  mb after  days and  gb for hotmail plus accounts yahoo mail went from  mb to  mb and  gb for yahoo mail plus accounts yahoo mail storage then increased to  mb and in late april  to  gb yahoo mail announced in may  that it would provide unlimited storage to all its users and began providing it in may  these were seen as moves to stop existing users from switching to gmail and to capitalize on the newly rekindled public interest in web mail services the desire to catch up was especially noted in the case of msns hotmail which upgraded its email storage from  mb to the new windows live hotmail which includes  gb of storage that expands if necessary in november  msn hotmail upgraded all free accounts to  gb of storage in june  aol started providing all aim screen names with their own email accounts with  gb of storage as well as increasing storage limits following the launch of gmail yahoo mail and hotmail also enhanced their email interfaces during  yahoo mail and hotmail matched gmails attachment size of  mb following the footsteps of gmail yahoo launched the yahoo mail beta service and microsoft launched windows live hotmail both incorporating ajax interfaces google increased the maximum attachment size to  mb in may  and to  mb in june  criticism privacy automated scanning of email content google automatically scans emails to add contextsensitive advertisements to them and to filter spam privacy advocates raised concerns that the plan involved scanning their personal private emails and that this was a security problem allowing email content to be read even by a computer raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email will be reduced furthermore email that nonsubscribers choose to send to gmail accounts is scanned by gmail as well even though those senders never agreed to gmails terms of service or privacy policy google can change its privacy policy unilaterally and google is technically able to crossreference cookies across its informationrich product line to make dossiers on individuals however most email systems make use of serverside content scanning in order to check for spam google defends its position by citing its use of emailscanning to the users benefit google states that gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages such as those that mention tragedy catastrophe or death in  thirtyone privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon google to suspend its gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed the letter also called upon google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units google has the ability to combine information contained in a persons email messages with information from internet searches but had not confirmed how long such information is kept or how it can be used one of the concerns was that it could be of interest to law enforcement agencies the organizations also voiced their concerns about googles plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider in march  a former gmail user in texas sued google claiming that its gmail service violates users privacy by scanning email messages to serve relevant ads in july  some california residents filed two class action lawsuits against google and yahoo claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual nongmail or nonyahoo subscribers to gmail and yahoo subscribers without their knowledge consent or permission a motion filed by googles attorneys in the case concedes that gmail users have no legitimate expectation of privacy in  microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack google for scanning email messages arguing that most consumers are not aware that google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads microsoft claims that its email service outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy googles kryptonite other concerns include the unlimited period for data retention that googles policies allow and the potential for unintended secondary uses of the information gmail collects and stores a court filing uncovered by advocacy group consumer watchdog in august  revealed that google stated in a court filing that no reasonable expectation exists among gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails in response to a lawsuit filed in may  google explained  all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing  just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipients assistant opens the letter people who use webbased email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipients ecs electronic communications service provider in the course of delivery a google spokesperson stated to the media on august   that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of gmail users very seriously google updated its terms of service for gmail in april  to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content the relevant revision states our automated systems analyse your content including emails to provide you personally relevant product features such as customised search results tailored advertising and spam and malware detection this analysis occurs as the content is sent received and when it is stored a google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies to be simple and easy for users to understand in response to the update jim killock executive director of the open rights group stated the really dangerous things that google is doing are things like the information held in analytics cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts other privacy issues gmails privacy policy used to contain the clause residual copies of deleted messages and accounts may take up to  days to be deleted from our active servers and may remain in our offline backup systems however this statement does not appear in gmails current privacy policy less specifically google has stated that in  they will make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practical gmail accounts of human rights activists in china were hacked in sophisticated attacks  thought to use phishing and exploit a vulnerability in internet explorer  in late  any web mail or other mail system which stores and retains users email contents is an attractive target for such attacks but gmail is popular with securityconscious users because of its early https secure encrypted connection support and its morerecent httpsonly default setting the launch of google buzz as an optout social networking service immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed gmail users contacts to view their other contacts buzz was discontinued in december  in december  gmail made changes in how images are displayed to improve protection against insecure content and by default remove the necessity for recipients to click the display images confirmation gmail now serves all images through googles own secure proxy servers it also removed the ability for email marketers to track ip user agent if it was a mobile open or which mobile device was used at the same time the default behavior was changed to show images without user confirmation thereby enabling senders to track the time when an email is first opened by the recipient by inserting tracking pixels while media such as wired criticized the change as weakening user privacy email marketing service provider mailchimp welcomed the improved capability to track previously invisible email subscribers a new gmail feature was launched in january  whereby users can email people with google accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient marc rotenberg president of the electronic privacy information center called the feature troubling the new feature is enabled by default but can be disabled technical limitations gmail does not allow users to send or receive executable files or archives containing executable files if it recognizes the file extension as one used for executable files or archives by design gmail does not deliver all of a users emails when downloading mail through pop or imap access gmail fails to deliver messages that users have sent to themselves if the client has a copy of it already it also does not deliver to a users inbox via any access interface those messages that users have sent to mailing lists and which they might expect to receive back via the mailing list gmail normally sorts email only by conversations threads which can be a problem for large conversations for example if a user sends a query to a large group of people all of the responses are stored in a single conversation that is impossible to break apart there is no way to search for responses from one user without getting the entire conversation while deletion of individual emails is possible most operations such as archiving and labeling can be performed only on whole conversations conversations cannot be split up or combined as a result of complaints from some users google made conversation view optional starting september   the change was only made for the web app the mobile app do not offer any option for disabling conversation view there is currently no method to split individual conversations in any gmail app gmail user names are period insensitive for email purposes examplegmailcom is the same email address as examplegmailcom gmail acknowledges this in their own help documents outages gmail has been unavailable on several occasions on february   the gmail service was offline for  hours and  minutes preventing millions of users from accessing their accounts people who rely entirely on gmail for business purposes complained about these outages later that day a google vice president ben treynor explained that the problem which ultimately resulted in about  minutes of outage was caused by overloaded routers triggered by a routine configuration change which added more router load than expected treynor wrote gmail remains more than  available to all users and were committed to keeping events like todays notable for their rarity in  google continued to experience outages across its network leaving users without access to their email calendars and virtual files key outage dates include on behalf of prior to july  any email sent through the gmail interface included the gmailcom address as the sender even if it was sent with a custom email address as from for example an email sent with an external from address using gmail could be displayed to a receiving email client user as from usergmailcom on behalf of userotherdomainemailaddresscom the display used by versions of microsoft outlook by exposing the gmail address google claimed that this would help prevent mail from being marked as spam a number of gmail users complained that this implementation was both a privacy concern and a professionalism problem on july   gmail announced an update to resolve this issue the updated custom from feature allows users to send messages from gmail using a custom smtp server instead of gmails however the issue is still present for users whose custom email address is a second gmail account rather than an account on a separate domain
