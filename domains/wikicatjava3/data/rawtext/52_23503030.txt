apache empiredb apache empiredb is a java library that provides a high level objectoriented api for accessing relational database management systems rdbms through jdbc apache empiredb is open source and provided under the apache  license from the apache software foundation compared to objectrelational mapping orm or other data persistence solutions such as hibernate ibatis or toplink empiredb does not use xml files or java annotations to provide a mapping of plain old java object pojos to database tables views and columns instead empiredb uses a java object model to describe the underlying data model and an api that works almost solely with object references rather than string literals empiredbs aim is to provide better software quality and improved maintainability through increased compiletime safety and reduced redundancy of metadata additionally applications may benefit from better performance due to full control over sql statements and their execution by the developer compared to most ormapping solutions major benefits empiredbs key strength is its api for dynamic sql generation for arbitrary select update insert or delete statements purely by using java methods which reference the model objects this provides typesafety and almost entirely eliminates the use of string literals for names or expressions in code additionally dbms independence is achieved through a pluggable driver model using references to table and column objects significantly improves compiletime safety and thus reduces the amount of testing as a positive side effect the ides code completion can be used to browse the data model increases productivity and eliminates the need for other external tools or ideplugins further the object model also provides safe and easy access to metainformation of the data model such as field data type maximum field length whether a field is mandatory and a finite choice of options for a fields values metadata is userextensible and not limited to dbms related metadata availability of metainformation encourages more generic code and eliminates redundancies throughout application layers example as an example consider a database with two tables called employees and departments for which a list of employees in a particular format with certain constraints and a given order should be retrieved the corresponding oracle syntax sql statement is assumed to be as follows this sql statement can be created using empiredbs command api using object model references like this in order to execute the query and retrieve a list of pojos holding the query result the following code may be used empiredb also supports field access through object references or obtaining query results as xml history empiredb was originally developed at esteam software a german software development company which used empiredb to develop various applications for a variety of different branches in january  empiredb was made officially open dource and first published though sourceforgenet in june  a proposal was submitted to the apache software foundation for empiredb to become an apache incubator project in july  empiredb got accepted for incubation and all rights over the software were transferred to the apache foundation in october  empiredb  was the first official apache incubator release with all package names changed to begin with orgapacheempire
