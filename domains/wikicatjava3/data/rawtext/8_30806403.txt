list of concurrent and parallel programming languages this article lists concurrent and parallel programming languages categorizing them by a defining paradigm a concurrent language is defined as one which uses the concept of simultaneously executing processes or threads of execution as a means of structuring a program a parallel language is able to express programs that are executable on more than one processor both types are listed as concurrency is a useful tool in expressing parallelism but it is not necessary in both cases the features must be part of the language syntax and not an extension such as a library the following categories aim to capture the main defining feature of the languages contained but they are not necessarily orthogonal apisframeworks these application programming interfaces support parallelism in host languages
