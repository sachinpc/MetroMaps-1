jnaerator jnaerator is a computer programming tool for the java programming language which automatically generates the java native access jna or bridj code needed to call c and objectivec libraries from java code it reads in ansi c header files and emits java code some optional customization can be done through command line options which can be saved in configuration files jnaerator does not need any native compiling beyond that of the targeted dynamic library all of the glue code is in java which helps simplify the process of binding java to c native libraries when compared to java native interface jnibased means its output is typically larger and harder to use than handcrafted jna bindings but it saves time and effort for bindings of large libraries with jna jnaerator studio while jnaerator is mainly a commandlinebased tool it also contains a limited gui thats ideal for simple quick generation experiments it can be launched from the web using the direct webstart link from the projects main page or by doubleclicking on jnaerators jar executable archive uses nativelibsjava gathers a few jnaeratorgenerated java wrappers for native libraries
