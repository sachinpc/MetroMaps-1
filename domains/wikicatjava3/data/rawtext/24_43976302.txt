nero aac codec nero aac codec is a set of software tools for encoding and decoding advanced audio coding aac format audio and editing mpeg metadata it was developed and distributed by nero ag and is available at no cost for windows and linux for noncommercial use the codec was originally part of nero digital but was later released as a standalone package neros aac encoder has been very competitive when tested against other encoders in scientific listening tests for a time second only to apples aac encoder in  chip magazine germany found that aac files encoded with the nero aac encoder would consume as little as half of the space on a portable music player when compared to mp files of similar audio quality components and capabilities the current package is labeled version  but contains the following three utilities the encoder and decoder support mpeg aac lc heaac aac lc  sbr and heaacv lc  sbr  ps audio object types sample rates up to khz and multichannel audio up to six channels  surround are supported the metadata utility can read and write nero digital itunes and memory stick format tags to mpeg containers these commandline tools are commonly used by shell scripts and programs like abcde exact audio copy and foobar to convert audio to aac history the codec was originally part of nero digital a complete mpeg audiovideo solution the aspavc video codec was developed by a french company called ateme nero built an inhouse team to develop the aac audio codec that included ivan dimkovic menno bakker and others dimkovic was the author of the psytel codec and the nero aac codec is said to be based on this work menno bakker was the developer of faac one of the earliest widely available aac encoders and also what would be become its companion decoder faad the nero aac codec became a standalone package around  although still called nero digital audio until  nero apparently still uses the codec in its products neither dimkovic nor bakker currently work at nero and development of the codec has stalled but the software is stable and remains a reliable and highquality option for aac encoding
