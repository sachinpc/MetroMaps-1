google web toolkit google web toolkit gwt  or gwt web toolkit is an open source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain complex javascript frontend applications in java other than a few native libraries everything is java source that can be built on any supported platform with the included gwt ant build files it is licensed under the apache license version  gwt emphasizes reusable approaches to common web development tasks namely asynchronous remote procedure calls history management bookmarking ui abstraction internationalization and crossbrowser portability history gwt version  rc  was released on may   google announced gwt at the javaone conference  in august  google acquired instantiations a company known for its focus on eclipse java developer tools including gwt designer which is now bundled with google plugin for eclipse in  with the introduction of the dart programming language google has reassured the gwt community that gwt will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future but also hinted at a possible rapprochement between the two google approaches to structured web programming theyve also admitted however that a number of engineers previously working on gwt are now working on dart in  at their annual io conference google announced that gwt would be transformed from a google project to a fully open sourced project in july  google posted on its gwt blog that the transformation to an open source project was complete development with gwt using gwt developers can develop and debug ajax applications in the java language using the java development tools of their choice when the application is deployed the gwt crosscompiler translates the java application to standalone javascript files that are optionally obfuscated and deeply optimized when needed javascript can also be embedded directly into java code using java comments gwt does not revolve only around user interface programming it is a general set of tools for building any sort of highperformance clientside javascript functionality indeed many key architectural decisions are left completely to the developer the gwt mission statement clarifies the philosophical breakdown of gwts role versus the developers role history is an example of such although gwt manages history tokens as users click back or forward in the browser it does not prescribe how to map history tokens to an application state gwt applications can be run in two modes several opensource plugins are available for making gwt development easier with other ides including gwtnb for netbeans cypal studio for gwt an eclipse plugin and gwt developer for jdeveloper the google plugin for eclipse handles most gwt related tasks in the ide including creating projects invoking the gwt compiler creating gwt launch configurations validation and syntax highlighting components the major gwt components include features available widgets as of version  september  gwt offers several widgets and panels many common widgets not found in the gwt have been implemented in thirdparty libraries such as sencha gxt formerly ext gwt gwt component library gwtext gwt widget library gwtiger rocket gwt dojo smartgwt etc enterprise usage gwt uses or supports java apache tomcat or similar web container eclipse ide internet explorer and internationalization and localization javabased gwt rias can be tested using junit testing framework and code coverage tools because gwt allows compile time verification of images css and business logic many common development defects are automatically discovered without need of the manual testing commonly required by rias google has noted that some of its products are gwt based other companies using gwt are listed on the gwt reference list and real world projects examples gwt  on dec   google launched google web toolkit  with speed tracer version  of gwt offers a number of new features including since the new development mode removed most platformspecific code the new version will be distributed as a unique archive instead of one per supported platform as was the case with previous versions mobile as a general framework for making web apps gwt is also capable of being used as a framework for making mobile and tablet apps either by making the needed widgets and animations from scratch or by using one of the mobile frameworks for gwt an html app written in gwt can have separate views for tablets and mobile phones some of the most common mobile gwt libraries
