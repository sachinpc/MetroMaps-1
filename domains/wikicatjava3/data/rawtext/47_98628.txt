magma computer algebra system magma is a computer algebra system designed to solve problems in algebra number theory geometry and combinatorics it is named after the algebraic structure magma it runs on unixlike operating systems as well as windows introduction magma is produced and distributed by the computational algebra group within the school of mathematics and statistics at the university of sydney in late  the book discovering mathematics with magma was published by springer as volume  of the algorithms and computations in mathematics series the magma system is used extensively within pure mathematics the computational algebra group maintain a list of publications that cite magma and as of  there are about  citations mostly in pure mathematics but also including papers from areas as diverse as economics and geophysics history the predecessor of the magma system was named cayley  after arthur cayley magma was officially released in august  version  version  of magma was released in june  and subsequent versions of x have been released approximately once per year in  the computational algebra group finalized an agreement with the simons foundation whereby the simons foundation will underwrite all costs of providing magma to all us nonprofit nongovernmental scientific research or educational institutions all students researchers and faculty associated with a participating institution will be able to access magma for free through that institution
