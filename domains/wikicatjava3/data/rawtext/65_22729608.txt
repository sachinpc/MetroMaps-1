zk framework zk is an opensource ajax web application framework written in java that enables creation of graphical user interfaces for web applications with little required programming knowledge the core of zk consists of an ajaxbased eventdriven mechanism over  xul and  xhtmlbased components and a markup language for designing user interfaces programmers design their application pages in featurerich xulxhtml components and manipulate them upon events triggered by end users activity it is similar to the programming model found in desktop guibased applications zk uses a servercentric approach in which the content synchronization of components and the event pipelining between clients and servers are automatically done by the engine and ajax plumbing codes are completely transparent to web application developers therefore the end users get the similar engaged interactivity and responsiveness as a desktop application while programmers development retains a similar simplicity to that of desktop applications its important to note that zk does not use the standard web request  response mechanism and does not send form fields to the server using get  query parameters or one post request instead ajax requests are sent to the server to update the internal state of each screen widget at the browser zk only downloads a json description of the web page and uses a client renderer to turn that into a ui its quite efficient and under closer inspection does not download everything at once a look at the traffic between client and the server reveals several requests going back and forth between client and browser until the page rendering eventually completes the optional clientside customization allows the developer to leverage the clientside resources with the socalled serverclient fusion for customization and to reduce the ajax traffic in addition to componentbased programming in a manner similar to swing zk supports a markup language for rich user interface definition called zuml zk  released on october   zk  aims to leverage the advancing clientside power with clientside command binding and template injection while still allowing the user to enjoy the equally important serverside integration and security its main features include ui templating for easily applying a predesigned layout clear viewlogic separation and effortless integration with thirdparty javascript libraries zuml zuml zk user interface markup language is a markup language for rich user interfaces definition clientside technologies zk is a servercentric framework technically you dont need to know about the implementation at the client side it is how zk mobile running on java mobile vm is done since zk  the socalled serverclient fusion architecture is introduced developers are allowed to access the clientside widgets directly if they want to zk client engine is based on jquery technically you can use jquerycompliant libraries and widgets zk addons zk charts provides a complete api which makes visualization of your data exceptionally easy the intuitive api allows you to present your serverside data on the client as zk charts handles the clientserver of data for you transparently zk pivottable an ajax data summarization component which takes raw data from a flat table and organizes them by desired categories arranged on columns and rows enabling developers to take advantage of a ready made component for demonstrating complex sets of data online zk spreadsheet an online collaboration for multiple users that allows user to control or configure web spreadsheet with pure java and seamlessly integrate java ee and other backend services
