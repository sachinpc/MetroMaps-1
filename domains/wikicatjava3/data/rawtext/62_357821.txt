multimedia home platform multimedia home platform dvbmhp is an open middleware system standard designed by the dvb project for interactive digital television the mhp enables the reception and execution of interactive javabased applications on a tvset interactive tv applications can be delivered over the broadcast channel together with audio and video streams these applications can be for example information services games interactive voting email sms or shopping mhp applications can use an additional return channel that has to support ip deployment in may  the largest deployments dvbmhp are in italy dvbt korea dvbs belgium dvbc and poland dvbs with trials or small deployments in germany spain austria colombia uruguay and australia mhp service was also offered in finland by finnish broadcasting corporation yleisradio but the service was shut down at the end of  after technical failure the shutdown wasnt ever officially announced ultimately the reason for the shutdown was that mhp never gained critical mass the main reasons for its lack of success in finland were   of the finnish households use the terrestrial network where broadcasting of mhp applications can be really expensive  tv broadcasters never told tv viewers about the mhp servicesbecause the digitalization of the tv networks got extremely negative publicity in finnish media the broadcasters didnt want to upset their customers further if they had bought new expensive stbs which werent capable of playing mhp apps and  there were only a few mhp settop boxes in the marketbecause finland is such a small market big manufacturers werent interested in developing new mhp boxes just for finland mhpcapable stbs are no longer available in finland the us cable industry has specified its own middleware system referred as ocap which is largely based on mhp currently belgiums largest cable provider telenet is rolling out their dvbmhp system called digibox norways upcoming terrestrial digital tv network ntv will also use the dvbmhp standard in late  the info channel in greece part of the ert digital platform started broadcasting dvbmhp info however since standards have not been set as of february  for digital television in greece most tv sets and dvbt receivers sold in the country do not feature dvbmhp technology the mhp specifies an extensive application execution environment for digital interactive tv independent of the underlying vendorspecific hardware and software this execution environment is based on the use of a java virtual machine and the definition of generic apis that provide access to the interactive digital tv terminals typical resources and facilities the interoperable mhp applications are running on top of these apis a socalled navigatorapplication which is part of the terminal software allows the user the access to all mhp applications and other dvb services like tv and radio sometimes navigator can be also a java program itself but that is not a requirement the mhp is just a part of a family of specifications which all base on the globally executable mhp gemstandard which was defined to allow the worldwide adoption of mhp dvbhtml mhp applications come in two flavours the first type are dvbhtml applications these are not very popular partly because the specification for dvbhtml was only completed with mhp  and partly because many broadcasters box manufacturers and content developers find it too complex and difficult to implement dvbhtml applications are a set of html pages that are broadcast as part of a service the spec is based around a modularized version of xhtml  and also includes css  dom  and ecmascript dvbj the second and by far the most popular flavour is dvbj dvbjava applications these are written in java using the mhp api set and consist of a set of class files that are broadcast with a service dvbjava applications are known as xlets these are a concept similar to applets for web pages that has been introduced by sun in the javatv specification like applets the xlet interface allows an external source the application manager in the case of an mhp receiver to start and stop an application return channel the mhp settop boxes may provide a backchannel for applications that wish to communicate with the outside world for example a voting or shopping application typical upstream backchannels are phone line or broadband internet connection adsl or k in italy using a modem included in the settop box dvbrct return channel terrestrial is a wireless technology utilizing the dvb infrastructure it provides a vhfuhf wireless return channel back to the broadcaster for interactive terrestrial tv it provides a datarate of several kbits per user for voting polls email teleshopping etc if return channel is present it should provide ip with tls support
