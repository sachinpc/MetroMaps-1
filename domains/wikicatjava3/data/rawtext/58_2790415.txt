java business integration java business integration jbi is a specification developed under the java community process jcp for an approach to implementing a serviceoriented architecture soa the jcp reference is jsr  for jbi  and jsr  for jbi  jsr  was removed from the jcp balloting process on  dec  by the submitters without being accepted jbi is built on a web services model and provides a pluggable architecture for a container that hosts service producer and consumer components services connect to the container via binding components bc or can be hosted inside the container as part of a service engine se the services model used is web services description language  the central message delivery mechanism the normalized message router nmr delivers normalized messages via one of four message exchange patterns meps taken from wsdl  to handle functionality that deals with installation deployment monitoring and lifecycle concerns amongst bcs and ses java management extensions jmx is used jbi defines standardized packaging for bcs and ses allowing components to be portable to any jbi implementation without modification jbi defines standard packaging for composite applications applications that are composed of service consumers and providers individual service units are deployable to components groups of service units are gathered together into a service assembly the service assembly includes metadata for wiring the service units together associating service providers and consumers as well as wiring service units to external services this provides a simple mechanism for performing composite application assembly using services jbi implementations the following opensource software jbi based esb implementations are available the following esbs are certified by the jbijsr  tck open esb and petals esb in addition the project glassfish opensource java ee application server comes with the jbi runtime from the open esb project java ee sdk also includes the jbi runtime and a bpel orchestration engine oracle claims its fusion middleware comes with jbi implementation tibco activematrix service grid provides a service container framework based on the jsr  and sca specifications service component architecture allowing service containers java java ee net bpel to be added as needed as composite applications on a common foundation existing jbi components the open jbi components project on javanet is an incubator project started to foster communitybased development of jbi components that conform to the java business integration specification jsr
