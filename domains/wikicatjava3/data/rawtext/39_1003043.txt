java d java d is a scene graph based d application programming interface api for the java platform it ran atop either opengl or directd until the version  which runs at the top of jogl since version  java d has been developed under the java community process a java d scene graph is a directed acyclic graph dag compared to other solutions java d is not only a wrapper around these graphics apis but an interface that encapsulates the graphics programming using a true objectoriented approach here a scene is constructed using a scene graph that is a representation of the objects that have to be shown this scene graph is structured as a tree containing several elements that are necessary to display the objects additionally java d offers extensive spatialized sound support java d and its documentation are available for download separately they are not part of the java development kit jdk history intel silicon graphics apple and sun all had retained mode scene graph apis under development in  since they all wanted to make a java version they decided to collaborate in making it that project became java d development was underway already in  a public beta version was released in march  the first version was released in december  from mid through summer  the development of java d was discontinued in the summer of  java d was released as a community source project and sun and volunteers have since been continuing its development on january   it was announced that improvements to java d would be put on hold to produce a d scene graph for javafx javafx with d support was eventually released with java  the javafx d graphics functionality has more or less come to supersede java d since february   the entire java d source code is released under the gpl version  license with gpl linking exception since february   java d uses jogl  for its hardware accelerated opengl rendering the port has been initiated by julien gouesse competing technologies java d is not the only highlevel api option to render d in java in part due to the pause in development during  and  several competing java scene graph technologies emerged general purpose gaming visualization in addition to those many other c or c scene graph apis offer java support through jni at a lower level the jogl jsr  opengl bindings for java are a popular alternative to scene graph apis such as java d lwjgl is another such binding
