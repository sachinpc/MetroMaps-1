wxwidgets wxwidgets  wixwidgets formerly wxwindows is a widget toolkit and tools library for creating graphical user interfaces guis for crossplatform applications wxwidgets enables a programs gui code to compile and run on several computer platforms with minimal or no code changes a wide choice of compilers and other tools to use with wxwidgets facilitates development of sophisticated applications wxwidgets supports a comprehensive range of popular operating systems and graphical libraries both proprietary and nonproprietary and is widely deployed in prominent organizations see text the project was started under the name wxwindows in  by julian smart at the university of edinburgh the project was renamed wxwidgets in  in response to a trademark claim by microsoft uk it is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the wxwidgets licence which satisfies those who wish to produce for gpl and proprietary software portability and deployment wxwidgets covers systems such as microsoft windows os x carbon and cocoa ios cocoa touch linuxunix x motif and gtk openvms os and amigaos a version for embedded systems is under development wxwidgets is used across many industry sectors most notably by xerox advanced micro devices amd lockheed martin nasa and the center for naval analyses it is also used in the public sector and education by for example dartmouth medical school national human genome research institute national center for biotechnology information and many others wxwidgets is used in many open source projects and by individual developers history wxwidgets initially wxwindows was started in  by julian smart at the university of edinburgh he attained an honours degree in computational science from the university of st andrews in  and is still a core developer on february   the developers of wxwindows announced that the project was changing its name to wxwidgets as a result of microsoft requesting julian smart to respect microsofts united kingdom trademark of the term windows major release versions were  on  january   on  april  and  on  december  version  was released on  november  wxwidgets has participated in the google summer of code since  the following table contains the release history of wxwidgets showing all of its major release versions licence wxwidgets is distributed under a custom made wxwindows licence similar to the gnu lesser general public licence lgpl with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may be distributed on the users own terms this licence is a free software licence approved by the fsf making wxwidgets free software it has been approved by the open source initiative osi official support supported platforms wxwidgets is supported on the following platforms supported compilers wxwidgets is officially confirmed to work properly with the following compilers programming language bindings the wxwidgets library is implemented in c with bindings available for many commonly used programming languages wxwidgets is best described as a native mode toolkit as it provides a thin abstraction to a platforms native widgets contrary to emulating the display of widgets using graphic primitives calling a native widget on the target platform results in a more native looking interface than toolkits such as swing for java as well as offering performance and other benefits the toolkit is also not restricted to gui development having an interprocess communication layer socket networking functionality and more rad tools and ides for wxwidgets there are many rapid application development rad and integrated development environment ide tools available among them applications built using wxwidgets notable applications that use wxwidgets
