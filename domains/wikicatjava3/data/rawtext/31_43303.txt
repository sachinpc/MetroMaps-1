mosaic web browser ncsa mosaic or simply mosaic is a discontinued early web browser it has been credited with popularizing the world wide web it was also a client for earlier protocols such as file transfer protocol network news transfer protocol and gopher the browser was named for its support of multiple internet protocols its intuitive interface reliability windows port and simple installation all contributed to its popularity within the web as well as on microsoft operating systems mosaic was also the first browser to display images inline with text instead of displaying images in a separate window while often described as the first graphical web browser mosaic was preceded by worldwideweb the lesserknown erwise and violawww mosaic was developed at the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa at the university of illinois urbanachampaign beginning in late  ncsa released the browser in  and officially discontinued development and support on january   however it can still be downloaded from ncsa netscape navigator was later developed by netscape which employed many of the original mosaic authors however it intentionally shared no code with mosaic netscape navigators code descendant is mozilla firefox starting in  mosaic lost a lot of share to netscape navigator and by  only had a tiny fraction of users left by which time the project was discontinued microsoft licensed the browser to create internet explorer in  background david thompson tested violawww and showed the application to marc andreessen andreessen and eric bina originally designed and programmed ncsa mosaic for unixs x window system called xmosaic then in december  the gore bill created and introduced by then senator and future vice president al gore was passed which provided the funding for the mosaic project development began in december  marc andreessen announced the project on jan   the first alpha release numbered a was published in june  and the first beta release numbered b followed quickly thereafter in september  version  for windows was released on november   ncsa mosaic for unix xwindows version  was released on november   a port of mosaic to the commodore amiga was available by october  ports to windows and macintosh had already been released in september from  to  the national science foundation supported the further development of mosaic marc andreessen the leader of the team that developed mosaic left ncsa and with james h clark one of the founders of silicon graphics inc sgi and four other former students and staff of the university of illinois started mosaic communications corporation mosaic communications eventually became netscape communications corporation producing netscape navigator  saw the first commercial product to incorporate mosaic sco global access a modified version of its open desktop version of unix that served as an internet gateway spyglass inc licensed the technology and trademarks from ncsa for producing their own web browser but never used any of the ncsa mosaic source code microsoft licensed spyglass mosaic in  for us million modified it and renamed it internet explorer after a later auditing dispute microsoft paid spyglass  million the  user guide the html sourcebook the complete guide to html specifically states in a section called coming attractions that internet explorer will be based on the mosaic program versions of internet explorer before version  stated based on ncsa mosaic in the about box internet explorer  was audited by microsoft to ensure that it contained no mosaic code and thus no longer credits spyglass or mosaic licensing the licensing terms for ncsa mosaic were generous for a proprietary software program in general noncommercial use was free of charge for all versions with certain limitations additionally the x window systemunix version publicly provided source code source code for the other versions was available after agreements were signed despite persistent rumors to the contrary however mosaic was never released as open source software during its brief reign as a major browser there were always constraints on permissible uses without payment as of  license holders included these immediate effect other browsers existed during this period notably erwise violawww midaswww and tkwww these browsers however did not have the same effect as mosaic on public use of the internet in the october  issue of wired magazine gary wolfe notes in the article titled the second phase of the revolution has begun dont look now but prodigy aol and compuserve are all suddenly obsolete  and mosaic is well on its way to becoming the worlds standard interface importance of mosaic mosaic was the web browser that led to the internet boom of the s robert reid underscores this importance stating while still an undergraduate marc wrote the mosaic software that made the web popularly relevant and touched off the revolution reid notes that andreessens team hoped mosaic is not the first web browser for windows this is thomas r bruces littleknown cello and the unix version of mosaic was already famous before the windows and mac versions were released other than displaying images embedded in the text rather than in a separate window mosaics original feature set is not greater than of the browsers on which it was modeled such as violawww but mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of fulltime programmers was reliable and easy enough for novices to install and the inline graphics reportedly proved immensely appealing mosaic is said to have made the web accessible to the ordinary person for the first time and already had  market share in  reid also refers to matthew k grays website internet statistics growth and usage of the web and the internet which indicates a dramatic leap in web use around the time of mosaics introduction in addition david hudson concurs with reid noting that ultimately web browsers such as mosaic became the killer applications of the s web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools the internets burgeoning wealth of distributed information services a mid guide lists mosaic alongside the traditional textoriented information search tools of the time archie and veronica gopher and wais but mosaic quickly subsumed and displaced them all joseph hardin the director of the ncsa group within which mosaic was developed said downloads were up to  a month in mid in november  there were twentysix websites in the world and each one attracted attention in its release year of  mosaic had a whats new page and about one new link was being added per day this was a time when access to the internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions yet it was the availability of mosaic and mosaicderived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the web to over  sites by aug  and millions by  metcalf expressed the pivotal role of mosaic this way end of mosaic mosaics popularity as a separate browser began to lessen upon the release of andreessens netscape navigator in  this was noted at the time in the html sourcebook the complete guide to html netscape communications has designed an allnew www browser netscape that has significant enhancements over the original mosaic program by  its user base had almost completely evaporated being replaced by other web browsers after ncsa stopped work on mosaic development of the ncsa mosaic for the x window system source code was continued by several independent groups these independent development efforts include mmosaic multicast mosaic which ceased development in early  and mosaicck and vms mosaic vms mosaic a version specifically targeting openvms operating system was one of the longestlived efforts to maintain mosaic using the vms support already builtin in original version bjorn s nilsson ported mosaic  to vms in the summer of  developers incorporated a substantial part of the html engine from mmosaic another defunct flavor of the browser  vms mosaic supported html  openssl cookies and various image formats including gif jpeg png bmp tga tiff and jpeg  image formats the browser works on vax alpha and itanium platforms another longlived version of mosaic  mosaicck developed by cameron kaiser  saw its last release version ck on july   a maintenance release with minor compatibility fixes version ck was released on  january  followed by another one ck in october  the stated goal of the project is lynx with graphics and runs on mac os x power machten linux and other compatible unixlike oss features mosaic is based on the libwww library and thus supported a wide variety of internet protocols included in the library archie ftp gopher http nntp telnet wais
