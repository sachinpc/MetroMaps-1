truecrypt truecrypt is a discontinued sourceavailable freeware utility used for onthefly encryption otfe it can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file or encrypt a partition or under microsoft windows except windows  boot drive with gpt the entire storage device preboot authentication on  may  the truecrypt website announced that the project was no longer maintained and recommended users to find alternative solutions though development of truecrypt has ceased an independent audit of truecrypt has concluded that no significant flaws are present alternatives include two freeware projects based on the truecrypt code veracrypt and ciphershed as well as numerous commercial and opensource products history truecrypt was initially released as version  in february  based on em encryption for the masses several versions and many additional minor releases have been made since then with the most current version being  em and securstar dispute original release of truecrypt was made by anonymous developers called the truecrypt team shortly after version  was released in  the truecrypt team reported receiving email from wilfried hafner manager of securstar a computer security company according to the truecrypt team hafner claimed in the email that the acknowledged author of em developer paul le roux had stolen the source code from securstar as an employee it was further stated that le roux illegally distributed em and authored an illegal license permitting anyone to base derivative work on the code and distribute it freely hafner alleges all versions of em always belonged only to securstar and le roux did not have any right to release it under such a license this led the truecrypt team to immediately stop developing and distributing truecrypt which they announced online through usenet truecrypt team member david tesak stated that le roux informed the team that there was a legal dispute between himself and securstar and that he received legal advisement not to comment on any issues of the case tesak concluded that should the truecrypt team continue distributing truecrypt le roux may ultimately be held liable and be forced to pay consequent damages to securstar to continue in good faith he said the team would need to verify the validity of the em license however because of le rouxs need to remain silent on the matter he was unable to confirm or deny its legitimacy keeping truecrypt development in limbo thereafter wouldbe visitors reported trouble accessing the truecrypt website and rd party mirrors appeared online making the source code and installer continually available outside of official sanction by the truecrypt team in the faq section of its website securstar maintains its claims of ownership over both em and scramdisk another free encryption program the company states that with those products securstar had a long tradition of open source software but that competitors had nothing better to do but to steal our source code causing the company to make its products closedsource forcing potential customers to place a substantial order and sign a nondisclosure agreement before being allowed to review the code for security le roux himself has denied developing truecrypt in a court hearing in march  in which he also confirmed he had written em on the other hand he did reportedly order employees of his around  to encrypt their hard drives with em later with truecrypt version  months later on  june  truecrypt  was released the new version contained a different digital signature than that of the original truecrypt team with the developers now being referred to as the truecrypt foundation the software license was also changed to the open source gnu general public license gpl however given the wide range of components with differing licenses making up the software and the contested nature of the legality of the programs release a few weeks later on  june version  was released under the original em license to avoid potential problems relating to the gpl license version a of the software was released on  october  on codice subdomain by may  the original truecrypt website returned and codice redirected visitors to codice end of life announcement on  may  the truecrypt official website codice began redirecting visitors to codice with a http  moved permanently status which warned that the software may contain unfixed security issues and that development of truecrypt was ended in may  following windows xps end of support the message noted that more recent versions of windows have builtin support for disk encryption using bitlocker and that linux and os x had similar builtin solutions which the message states renders truecrypt unnecessary the page recommends any data encrypted by truecrypt be migrated to other encryption setups and offered instructions on moving to bitlocker the sourceforge project page for the software at codice was updated to display the same initial message and the status was changed to inactive the page also announced a new software version  which only allows decryption initially the authenticity of the announcement and new software was questioned multiple theories attempting to explain the reason behind the announcement arose throughout the tech community shortly after the final release announcement titled yes truecrypt is still safe to use gibson research corporation posted a final release repository to host the last official readwrite capable version of truecrypt from which the option to create new containers was removed they also posted an article addressing the security concerns of current users and documenting community efforts to continue the project alternatives truecrypt may still be used on supported platforms there are at least three truecrypt forks as well as opensource and commercial alternatives ciphershed as of june  there is also a software fork named ciphershed with resources and infrastructure funded by codice developed by codice and audited by a crowdfunded security audit team cf  veracrypt veracrypt is a fork of truecrypt security improvements have been implemented and issues raised by the truecrypt code audit just before the truecrypt developers retired have been addressed command line a free commandline implementation named tcplay is available for linux and dragonfly bsd under bsd license its disk encryption method and container format are still managed by linux kernel via dmcrypt module operating systems truecrypt supports windows os x and linux operating systems both bit and bit versions of these operating systems are supported except for windows ia not supported and mac os x  snow leopard runs as a bit process the version for windows  windows vista and windows xp can encrypt the boot partition or entire boot drive independent implementations there is an independent compatible implementation tcplay for dragonfly bsd and linux the dmcrypt module included in default linux kernel supports a truecrypt target called tcw since linux version  encryption scheme algorithms individual ciphers supported by truecrypt are aes serpent and twofish additionally five different combinations of cascaded algorithms are available aestwofish aestwofishserpent serpentaes serpenttwofishaes and twofishserpent the cryptographic hash functions available for use in truecrypt are ripemd sha and whirlpool modes of operation truecrypt currently uses the xts mode of operation prior to this truecrypt used lrw mode in versions  through a and cbc mode in versions  and earlier xts mode is thought to be more secure than lrw mode which in turn is more secure than cbc mode although new volumes can only be created in xts mode truecrypt is backward compatible with older volumes using lrw mode and cbc mode later versions produce a security warning when mounting cbc mode volumes and recommend that they be replaced with new volumes in xts mode keys the header key and the secondary header key xts mode are generated using pbkdf with a bit salt and  or  iterations depending on the underlying hash function used plausible deniability truecrypt supports a concept called plausible deniability by allowing a single hidden volume to be created within another volume in addition the windows versions of truecrypt have the ability to create and run a hidden encrypted operating system whose existence may be denied the truecrypt documentation lists many ways in which truecrypts hidden volume deniability features may be compromised eg by third party software which may leak information through temporary files thumbnails etc to unencrypted disks and possible ways to avoid this in a paper published in  and focused on the then latest version va and its plausible deniability a team of security researchers led by bruce schneier states that windows vista microsoft word google desktop and others store information on unencrypted disks which might compromise truecrypts plausible deniability the study suggested the addition of a hidden operating system functionality this feature was added in truecrypt  when a hidden operating system is running truecrypt also makes local unencrypted filesystems and nonhidden truecrypt volumes readonly to prevent data leaks the security of truecrypts implementation of this feature was not evaluated because the first version of truecrypt with this option had only recently been released there was a functional evaluation of the deniability of hidden volumes in an earlier version of truecrypt by schneier et al that found security leaks identifying truecrypt volumes when analyzed truecrypt volumes appear to have no header and contain random data truecrypt volumes have sizes that are multiples of  due to the block size of the cipher mode and key data is either  bytes stored separately in the case of system encryption or two kb headers for nonsystem containers forensics tools may use these properties of file size apparent lack of a header and randomness tests to attempt to identify truecrypt volumes although these features give reason to suspect a file to be a truecrypt volume there are however some programs which exist for the purpose of securely erasing files by employing a method of overwriting file contents and free disk space with purely random data ie shred  scrub thereby creating reasonable doubt to counter pointed accusations declaring a file made of statistically random data to be a truecrypt file if a system drive or a partition on it has been encrypted with truecrypt then only the data on that partition is deniable when the truecrypt boot loader replaces the normal boot loader an offline analysis of the drive can positively determine that a truecrypt boot loader is present and so lead to the logical inference that a truecrypt partition is also present even though there are features to obfuscate its purpose ie displaying a bioslike message to misdirect an observer such as nonsystem disk or disk error these reduce the functionality of the truecrypt boot loader and do not hide the content of the truecrypt boot loader from offline analysis here again the use of a hidden operating system is the suggested method for retaining deniability performance truecrypt supports parallelized encryption for multicore systems and under microsoft windows pipelined readwrite operations a form of asynchronous processing to reduce the performance hit of encryption and decryption on newer processors supporting the aesni instruction set truecrypt supports hardwareaccelerated aes to further improve performance the performance impact of disk encryption is especially noticeable on operations which would normally use direct memory access dma as all data must pass through the cpu for decryption rather than being copied directly from disk to ram in a test carried out by toms hardware although truecrypt is slower compared to an unencrypted disk the overhead of realtime encryption was found to be similar regardless of whether midrange or stateoftheart hardware is in use and this impact was quite acceptable in another article the performance cost was found to be unnoticeable when working with popular desktop applications in a reasonable manner but it was noted that power users will complain incompatibility with flexnet publisher and safecast installing thirdparty software which uses flexnet publisher or safecast which are used for preventing software piracy on products by adobe such as adobe photoshop can damage the truecrypt bootloader on windows partitionsdrives encrypted by truecrypt and render the drive unbootable this is caused by the inappropriate design of flexnet publisher writing to the first drive track and overwriting whatever nonwindows bootloader exists there security concerns truecrypt is vulnerable to various known attacks which are also present in other softwarebased disk encryption software such as bitlocker to prevent those the documentation distributed with truecrypt requires users to follow various security precautions some of those attacks are detailed below encryption keys stored in memory truecrypt stores its keys in ram on an ordinary personal computer the dram will maintain its contents for several seconds after power is cut or longer if the temperature is lowered even if there is some degradation in the memory contents various algorithms can intelligently recover the keys this method known as a cold boot attack which would apply in particular to a notebook computer obtained while in poweron suspended or screenlocked mode has been successfully used to attack a file system protected by truecrypt physical security truecrypt documentation states that truecrypt is unable to secure data on a computer if an attacker physically accessed it and truecrypt is used on the compromised computer by the user again this does not apply to a common case of a stolen lost or confiscated computer the attacker having physical access to a computer can for example install a hardwaresoftware keylogger a busmastering device capturing memory or install any other malicious hardware or software allowing the attacker to capture unencrypted data including encryption keys and passwords or to decrypt encrypted data using captured passwords or encryption keys therefore physical security is a basic premise of a secure system attacks such as this are often called evil maid attacks malware truecrypt documentation states that truecrypt cannot secure data on a computer if it has any kind of malware installed malware may log keystrokes thus exposing passwords to an attacker the stoned bootkit the stoned bootkit an mbr rootkit presented by austrian software developer peter kleissner at the black hat technical security conference usa  has been shown capable of tampering truecrypts mbr effectively bypassing truecrypts full volume encryption potentially every hard disk encryption software is affected by this kind of attack if the encryption software does not rely on hardwarebased encryption technologies like tpm or if the attack is made with administrative privileges while the encrypted operating system is running two types of attack scenarios exist in which it is possible to maliciously take advantage of this bootkit in the first one the user is required to launch the bootkit with administrative privileges once the pc has already booted into windows in the second one analogously to hardware keyloggers a malicious person needs physical access to the users truecryptencrypted hard disk in this context this is needed to modify the users truecrypt mbr with that of the stoned bootkit and then place the hard disk back on the unknowing users pc so that when the user boots the pc and types hisher truecrypt password on boot the stoned bootkit intercepts it thereafter because from that moment on the stoned bootkit is loaded before truecrypts mbr in the boot sequence the first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices eg avoid running nontrusted executables with administrative privileges the second one can be successfully neutralized by the user if heshe suspects that the encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone heshe does not trust by booting the encrypted operating system with truecrypts rescue disk instead of booting it directly from the hard disk with the rescue disk the user can restore truecrypts mbr to the hard disk trusted platform module the faq section of the truecrypt website states that the trusted platform module tpm cannot be relied upon for security because if the attacker has physical or administrative access to the computer and you use it afterwards the computer could have been modified by the attacker eg a malicious componentsuch as a hardware keystroke loggercould have been used to capture the password or other sensitive information since the tpm does not prevent an attacker from maliciously modifying the computer truecrypt will not support the tpm security audits in  a graduate student at concordia university published a detailed online report in which he states that he has confirmed the integrity of the distributed windows binaries of version a a crowdfunding campaign attempting to conduct an independent security audit of truecrypt was successfully funded in october  a nonprofit organization called the open crypto audit project ocap was formed calling itself a communitydriven global initiative which grew out of the first comprehensive public audit and cryptanalysis of the widely used encryption software truecrypt the organization established contact with truecrypt developers who welcomed the audit phase i of the audit was successfully completed on  april  finding no evidence of backdoors or malicious code matthew d green one of the auditors added i think its good that we didnt find anything super critical one day after truecrypts end of life announcement ocap confirmed that the audit would continue as planned with phase ii expected to begin in june  and wrap up by the end of september the phase ii audit was delayed but was completed  april  by ncc cryptography services this audit found no evidence of deliberate backdoors or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances the french national agency for the security of information systems anssi stated that while truecrypt  and a have previously attained anssi certification migration to an alternate certified product is recommended as a precautionary measure according to gibson research corporation steven barnhart wrote to an email address for a truecrypt foundation member he had used in the past and received several replies from david according to barnhart the main points of the email messages were that the truecrypt foundation was happy with the audit it didnt spark anything and that the reason for the announcement was that there is no longer interest in maintaining the project according to a study released  september  truecrypt includes two vulnerabilities in the driver that truecrypt installs on windows systems allowing an attacker full system compromise in january  veracrypt fixed a vulnerability in their executable installers for windows that allowed arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation via dll hijacking this vulnerability remains unpatched in truecrypts unmaintained installers legal cases operation satyagraha in july  several truecryptsecured hard drives were seized from brazilian banker daniel dantas who was suspected of financial crimes the brazilian national institute of criminology inc tried unsuccessfully for five months to obtain access to his files on the truecryptprotected disks they enlisted the help of the fbi who used dictionary attacks against dantas disks for over  months but were still unable to decrypt them united states v john doe in  the united states th circuit court of appeals ruled that a john doe truecrypt user could not be compelled to decrypt several of his hard drives the courts ruling noted that fbi forensic examiners were unable to get past truecrypts encryption and therefore were unable to access the data unless doe either decrypted the drives or gave the fbi the password and the court then ruled that does fifth amendment right to remain silent legally prevented the government from making him or her do so david miranda on  august  david miranda partner of journalist glenn greenwald was detained at londons heathrow airport by metropolitan police while en route to rio de janeiro from berlin he was carrying with him an external hard drive said to be containing sensitive documents pertaining to the  global surveillance disclosures sparked by edward snowden contents of the drive were encrypted by truecrypt which authorities said renders the material extremely difficult to access detective superintendent caroline goode stated the hard drive contained around  gigabytes of data of which only  have been accessed to date she further stated the process to decode the material was complex and so far only  documents have been reconstructed since the property was initially received guardian contributor naomi colvin concluded the statements were misleading stating that it was possible goode was not even referring to any actual encrypted material but rather deleted files reconstructed from unencrypted unallocated space on the hard drive or even plaintext documents from mirandas personal effects glenn greenwald supported this assessment in an interview with democracy now mentioning that the uk government filed an affidavit asking the court to allow them to retain possession of mirandas belongings the grounds for the request were that they could not break the encryption and were only able to access  of the documents that he was carrying which greenwald said most of which were probably ones related to his school work and personal use james desilva in february  an arizona department of real estate it department employee james desilva was arrested on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor through the sharing of explicit images over the internet his computer encrypted with truecrypt was seized and desilva refused to reveal the password forensics detectives from the maricopa county sheriffs office were unable to gain access to his stored files lauri love in october  britishfinnish activist lauri love was arrested by the national crime agency nca on charges of hacking into a us department or agency computer and one count of conspiring to do the same the government confiscated all of his electronics and demanded he provide them with the necessary keys to decrypt the devices love refused on  may  a district judge magistrates court rejected a request by the nca that love be forced to turn over his encryption keys or passwords to truecrypt files on an sd card and hard drives that were among the confiscated property license and source model truecrypt was released under the truecrypt license which is unique to the truecrypt software it is not part of the pantheon of widely used open source licenses and is not a free software license according to the free software foundation fsf license list as it contains distribution and copyrightliability restrictions as of version a the last full version of the software released feb  the truecrypt license was version  discussion of the licensing terms on the open source initiative osis licensediscuss mailing list in october  suggests that the truecrypt license has made progress towards compliance with the open source definition but would not yet pass if proposed for certification as open source software according to current osi president simon phipps it is not at all appropriate for truecrypt to describe itself as open source this use of the term open source to describe something under a license thats not only unapproved by osi but known to be subject to issues is unacceptable as a result of its questionable status with regard to copyright restrictions and other potential legal issues the truecrypt license is not considered free by several major linux distributions and is therefore not included in debian ubuntu fedora or opensuse the wording of the license raises doubts whether those who use it have the right to modify it and use it within other projects cryptographer matthew green noted that there are a lot of things the developers could have done to make it easier for people to take over this code including fixing the licensing situation and speculates that since they didnt do those things including making the license more friendly their intent was to prevent anyone from building on their code in the future end of life and license version   may  announcement of discontinuation of truecrypt also came with a new version  of the software among the many changes to the source code from the previous release were changes to the truecrypt license  including removal of specific language that required attribution of truecrypt as well as a link to the official website to be included on any derivative products  forming a license version  on  june  the only alleged truecrypt developer still answering email replied to a message by matthew green with regards to the licensing situation he is not willing to change the license to an open source one believes that truecrypt should not be forked and that if someone wants to create a new version they should start from scratch trademarks the truecrypt trademark was registered in the czech republic under name of david tesak in the us the truecrypt trademark also was registered under name of david tesak as well as the trademark of the logo the company truecrypt was registered in the us by a person named ondrej tesarik this nonprofit organization was functional as far as it has filed tax returns planned features before the end of life notice the truecrypt website stated that the following features were planned for future releases
