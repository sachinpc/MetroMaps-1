line mode browser the line mode browser also known as lmb or just www is the second web browser ever created the browser was the first demonstrated to be portable to several different operating systems operated from a simple commandline interface it could be widely used on many computers and computer terminals throughout the internet the browser was developed starting in  and then supported by the world wide web consortium wc as an example and test application for the libwww library history one of the fundamental concepts of the world wide web projects at cern was universal readership in  tim bernerslee had already written the first browser worldwideweb later renamed to nexus but that program only worked on the proprietary software of next computers which were in limited use bernerslee and his team could not port the worldwideweb application with its featuresincluding the graphical wysiwyg editor to the more widely deployed x window system since they had no experience in programming it the team recruited nicola pellow a math student intern working at cern to write a passive browser so basic that it could run on most computers of that time the name line mode browser refers to the fact that to ensure compatibility with the earliest computer terminals such as teletype machines the program only displayed text no images and had only text input development started in november  and the browser was demonstrated in december  the development environment used resources from the priam project a french language acronym for projet interdivisionnaire dassistance aux microprocesseurs a project to standardise microprocessor development across cern the short development time produced software in a simplified dialect of the c programming language the official standard ansi c was not yet available on all platforms the line mode browser was released to a limited audience on vax rs and sun computers in march  before the release of the first publicly available version it was integrated into the cern program library cernlib used mostly by the highenergy physicscommunity the first beta of the browser was released on  april  bernerslee announced the browsers availability in june  in the althypertext newsgroup of usenet users could use the browser from anywhere in the internet through the telnet protocol to the infocernch machine which was also the first web server the spreading news of the world wide web in  increased interest in the project at cern and other laboratories such as desy in germany and elsewhere throughout the world the first stable version  was released in january  since version l released in october  the browser has used the common code library later called libwww the main developer pellow started working on the macwww project and both browsers began to share some source code in the may  world wide web newsletter bernerslee announced that the browser was released into the public domain to reduce the work on new clients on  march  with the release of version  cern put the full responsibility for maintaining the line mode browser on the wc the line mode browser and the libwww library are closely tied togetherthe last independent release of a separate browser component was in  and the browser became part of libwww the agora world wide web email browser was based on the line mode browser the line mode browser was very popular in the beginning of the web since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems statistics from january  show that mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only  of all world wide web users browsed by line mode browser the new niche of textonly web browser was filled by lynx which made the line mode browser largely irrelevant as a browser one reason was that lynx is much more flexible than the line mode browser it then became a test application for the libwww operating mode the simplicity of the line mode browser had several limitations the line mode browser was designed to work on any operating system using what were called dumb terminals the user interface had to be as simple as possible the user began with a commandline interface specifying a uniform resource locator url the requested web page was then printed line by line on the screen like a teleprinter websites were displayed using the first versions of html formatting was achieved with capitalization indentation and new lines header elements were capitalized centered and separated from the normal text by empty lines navigation was not controlled by a pointing device such as a mouse or arrow keys but by text commands typed into the program numbers in brackets are displayed for each link links are opened by typing the corresponding number into the program this led one journalist of the time to write the web is a way of finding information by typing numbers the page scrolled down when an empty command carriage return was entered and scrolled up with the command codice the command codice navigated backwards in history and new pages were navigated with codice for go to and the url the browser had no authoring functions so pages could only be read and not edited this was considered to be unfortunate by robert cailliau one of the developers i think in retrospect the biggest mistake made in the whole project was the public release of the linemode browser it gave the internet hackers immediate access but only from the point of view of the passive browser  no editing capabilities features the line mode browser was designed to be able to be platform independent there are official ports to apollodomain ibm rs decstationultrix vaxvms vaxultrix msdos unix windows classic mac os linux mvs vmcms freebsd solaris and to mac os x the browser supports many protocols like file transfer protocol ftp gopher hypertext transfer protocol http network news transfer protocol nntp and wide area information server wais other features included rlogin and telnet hyperlinks cyrillic support added at  november  in version  and ability to be set up as a proxy client the browser could run as a background process and download files the line mode browser has had problems recognizing character entities properly collapsing whitespace and supporting tables and frames
