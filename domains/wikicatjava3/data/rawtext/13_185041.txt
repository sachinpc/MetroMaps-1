companys modern design language on september   the new msn portal features a new version of the logo that follows a style similar to other current microsoft products the website no longer offers

simplified into a new home page and categories most of which have corresponding apps the top of the home page provides access to microsoft services bing outlookcom skype office online onenote onedrive bing maps and groove music as well as popular social media services facebook and twitter signing into msn with a microsoft account allows for personalized content to appear and to be synchronized across devices on the website and in the corresponding apps the redesign of the website led to the closure of msns longtime personalized home page service my msn which was made up of customized rss feeds as the new website no longer supports userspecified rss content however it added some customizability allowing each category on the home page to be reordered or hidden with the  relaunch msn now
