ip the invisible internet project ip is an overlay network and darknet that allows applications to send messages to each other pseudonymously and securely uses include anonymous web surfing chatting blogging and file transfers the software that implements this layer is called an ip router and a computer running ip is called an ip node the software is free and open source and is published under multiple licenses the name ip is derived from invisible internet project which in pseudomathematical notation is represented as ip technical design ip is beta software since  developers emphasize that there are likely to be bugs in the software and that there has been insufficient peer review to date however they believe the code is now reasonably stable and welldeveloped and more exposure can help development of ip the network itself is strictly messagebased like ip but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it similar to tcp although from version  there is a new udpbased ssu transport all communication is endtoend encrypted in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message and even the end points destinations are cryptographic identifiers essentially a pair of public keys so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their ip address to the other side or to thirdparty observers although many developers had been a part of the invisible irc project iip and freenet communities there are significant differences between their designs and concepts iip was an anonymous centralized irc server freenet is a censorshipresistant distributed data store ip is an anonymous peertopeer distributed communication layer designed to run any traditional internet service eg usenet email irc file sharing web hosting and http telnet as well as more traditional distributed applications eg a distributed data store a web proxy network using squid or dns many developers of ip are known only under pseudonyms while the previous main developer jrandom is currently on hiatus others such as zzz killyourtv and complication have continued to lead development efforts and are assisted by numerous contributors releases ip has had a stable release every six to eight weeks updates are distributed via ip torrents and are signed by the release manager generally zzz or strd software since ip is an anonymous network layer it is designed so other software can use it for anonymous communication as such there are a variety of tools currently available for ip or in development the ip router is controlled through the router console which is a web frontend accessed through a web browser file sharing bridging to clearnet currently vuze is the only torrent client that makes clearnet connections not through ip torrents available on ip and vice versa it has a plugin that connects to the ip network if the user adds a torrent initially made for ip it will be seeded on both ip and the clearnet if a user adds a torrent from the clearnet it will be seeded on both the clearnet and ip for this reason torrents previously published only on ip are made available to the entire internet and users of ip can download any torrent on the internet while maintaining the anonymity of ip the privacy solutions project the privacy solutions project a new organization that develops and maintains ip software launched several new development efforts designed to enhance the privacy security and anonymity for users based on ip protocols and technology these efforts include the code repository and download sections for the ipd and abscond project is available for the public to review and download effective january  ipd is operating under purpleip cryptocurrency current crypto currencies that support ip or plan it are listed below ipcon from the first ip convention was held in toronto ontario the conference was hosted by a local hackerspace hacklab the conference featured presentations from ip developers security researchers
