java platform enterprise edition java platform enterprise edition or java ee is a widely used computing platform for enterprise software the platform provides an api and runtime environment for developing and running enterprise software including network and web services and other largescale multitiered scalable reliable and secure network applications java ee extends the java platform standard edition java se providing an api for objectrelational mapping distributed and multitier architectures and web services the platform incorporates a design based largely on modular components running on an application server software for java ee is primarily developed in the java programming language the platform emphasizes convention over configuration and annotations for configuration optionally xml can be used to override annotations or to deviate from the platform defaults java ee is developed under the java community process version history the platform was known as java  platform enterprise edition or jee until the name was changed to java platform enterprise edition or java ee in version  the current version is called java ee  standards and specifications java ee is defined by its specification as with other java community process specifications providers must meet certain conformance requirements in order to declare their products as java ee compliant java ee includes several api specifications such as rmi email jms web services xml etc and defines how to coordinate them java ee also features some specifications unique to java ee for components these include enterprise javabeans connectors servlets javaserver pages and several web service technologies this allows developers to create enterprise applications that are portable and scalable and that integrate with legacy technologies a java ee application server can handle transactions security scalability concurrency and management of the components it is deploying in order to enable developers to concentrate more on the business logic of the components rather than on infrastructure and integration tasks general apis the java ee apis includes several technologies that extend the functionality of the base java se apis web profile in an attempt to limit the footprint of web containers both in physical and in conceptual terms the web profile was created a subset of the java ee specifications the java ee web profile comprises the following certified application servers although by definition all java ee implementations provide the same base level of technologies namely the java ee spec and the associated apis they can differ considerably with respect to extra features like connectors clustering fault tolerance high availability security etc installed size memory footprint startup time etc
