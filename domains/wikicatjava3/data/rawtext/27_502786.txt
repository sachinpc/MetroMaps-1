joule programming language joule is a concurrent dataflow programming language designed for building distributed applications it is so concurrent that the order of statements within a block is irrelevant to the operation of the block statements are executed whenever possible based on their inputs everything in joule happens by sending messages there is no control flow instead the programmer describes the flow of data making it a dataflow programming language it is considered the precursor to the e programming language language syntax numerals consist of ascii digits  identifiers are unicode sequences of digits letters and operator characters that begin with a letter it is also possible to form identifiers by using unicode sequences including whitespace enclosed by either straight   or standard   single quotes where the backslash is the escape character keywords have to start with a letter except the  keyword to send information operators consist of unicode sequences of digits letters and operator characters beginning with an operator character labels are identifiers followed by a colon  at the root joule is an imperative language and because of that a statementbased language it has a rich expression syntax which transforms easily to its relational syntax underneath complex expressions become separate statements where the site of the original expression is replaced by a reference to the acceptor of the results channel therefore nested expressions still compute completely concurrently with their embedding statement an identifiers may name a channel to communicate with the server if this is the case it is said to be bound to that channel
