akka toolkit akka is an opensource toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the jvm akka supports multiple programming models for concurrency but it emphasizes actorbased concurrency with inspiration drawn from erlang language bindings exist for both java and scala akka is written in scala and as of scala  akkas actor implementation is included as part of the scala standard library history an actor implementation written by philipp haller was released in july  as part of scala  by  scala was attracting attention for use in complex server applications but concurrency was still typically achieved by creating threads that shared memory and synchronized when necessary using locks aware of the difficulties with that approach and inspired by the erlang programming languages library support for writing highly concurrent eventdriven applications jonas bonr created akka to bring similar capabilities to scala and java bonr began working on akka in early  and wrote up his vision for it in june of that year the first public release was akka  announced in january  akka is now part of the lightbend platform together with the play framework and the scala programming language distinguishing features the key points distinguishing applications based on akka actors are akka has a modular structure with a core module providing actors other modules are available to add features such as network distribution of actors cluster support command and event sourcing integration with various thirdparty systems eg apache camel zeromq and even support for other concurrency models such as futures and agents project structure viktor klang became the technical lead for the akka project in september  when viktor became director of engineering at lightbend in december  roland kuhn became the technical lead for akka the main part of the development is done by a core team employed at lightbend supported by an active community the current emphasis is on extending cluster support relation to other libraries other frameworks and toolkits have emerged to form an ecosystem around akka akka actors are considered an integral part of the scala standard library there are more than  public projects registered on github which use akka publications about akka there are several books about akka akka also features in besides many web articles describe the commercial use of akka there are also overview articles about it
