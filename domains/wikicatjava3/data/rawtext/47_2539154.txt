orange software orange is a free software machine learning and data mining package written in python it has a visual programming frontend for explorative data analysis and visualization and can also be used as a python library the program is maintained and developed by the bioinformatics laboratory of the faculty of computer and information science at university of ljubljana description orange is a componentbased visual programming software package for data mining machine learning and data analysis components are called widgets and they range from simple data visualization subset selection and preprocessing to empirical evaluation of learning algorithms and predictive modeling visual programming is implemented through an interface in which workflows are created by linking predefined or userdesigned widgets while advanced users can use orange as a python library for data manipulation and widget alteration software orange is an opensource software package released under gpl and available for use on github versions up to  include core components in c with wrappers in python from version  onwards orange uses common python opensource libraries for scientific computing such as numpy scipy and scikitlearn while its graphical user interface operates within the crossplatform qt framework the default installation includes a number of machine learning preprocessing and data visualization algorithms in  widget sets data visualize classify regression evaluate and unsupervised additional functionalities are available as addons bioinformatics data fusion and textmining orange is supported on os x windows and linux and can also be installed from the python package index repository pip install orange as of  the stable version is  and runs with python  while the legacy version  that runs with python  is still available features orange consists of a canvas interface onto which the user places widgets and creates a data analysis workflow widgets offer basic functionalities such as reading the data showing a data table selecting features training predictors comparing learning algorithms visualizing data elements etc the user can interactively explore visualizations or feed the selected subset into other widgets objectives the program provides a platform for experiment selection recommendation systems and predictive modeling and is used in biomedicine bioinformatics genomic research and teaching in science it is used as a platform for testing new machine learning algorithms and for implementing new techniques in genetics and bioinformatics in education it was used for teaching machine learning and data mining methods to students of biology biomedicine and informatics
