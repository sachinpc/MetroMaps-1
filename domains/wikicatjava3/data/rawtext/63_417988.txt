connected limited device configuration the connected limited device configuration cldc is a specification of a framework for java me applications describing the basic set of libraries and virtualmachine features that must be present in an implementation the cldc is combined with one or more profiles to give developers a platform for building applications on embedded devices with very limited resources such as pagers and mobile phones the cldc was developed under the java community process as jsr  cldc  and jsr  cldc  typical requirements cldc is designed for devices that have limited processing power memory and graphical capability devices typically have the following features noteworthy limitations compared to the java se environment several apis are absent entirely and some apis are altered such that code requires explicit changes to support cldc in particular certain changes arent just the absence of classes or interfaces but actually change the signatures of existing classes in the base class library an example of this is the absence of the codice interface which does not appear in the base class library due to restrictions on reflection usage all codice classes which normally implement codice do not therefore implement this tagging interface other examples of limitations depend on the version being used as some features were reintroduced with version  of cldc profiles a profile is a set of apis that support devices with different capabilities and resources within the cldc framework to provide a complete java application environment there are specific profiles for devices ranging from vending machines to settop boxes with the mobile phone profile midp being the most prevalent mobile information device profile the mobile information device profile is a profile designed for cell phones there are two versions of midp available specified in jsr  midp  and jsr  midp  both versions provide an lcd oriented gui api with midp  including a basic d gaming api applications written to use this profile are called midlets many cell phones come with a midp implementation and it is a popular platform for downloadable cell phone games information module profile the information module profile is specified in jsr  and is designed for vending machines network cards routers telephone boxes and other systems with either simple or no display and some form of limited two way network access only apis for application creation storage and network access are defined these are a subset of the javaxmicroeditionio rms and midlet packages in midp siemens mobile and nokia put forward this specification to the jcp doja profile the doja profile was designed for docomos imode mobile phone by ntt docomo digital set top box profile the digital set top box profile specified in jsr  is designed for the cable market also referred to as onramp this profile is based on a subset of the opencable application platform ocap which defines a set of apis for the development of applications for settop boxes and similar devices the profile consists of subsets from the cdc personal basis profile including support for awt xlet file access and network apis as well as several mediarelated interfaces from ocap the whole profile encompassed  java packages and approximately  apis optional packages the pda optional packages are specified in jsr and are designed for pdas such as palm or windows ce devices the specification defines two independent packages that represent important features found on many pdas and other mobile devices these packages are
