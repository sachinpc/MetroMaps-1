sisal sisal streams and iteration in a single assignment language is a generalpurpose single assignment functional programming language with strict semantics implicit parallelism and efficient array handling sisal outputs a dataflow graph in intermediary form  if it was derived from val valueoriented algorithmic language designed by jack dennis and adds recursion and finite streams it has a pascallike syntax and was designed to be a common highlevel language for numerical programs on a variety of multiprocessors history sisal was defined in  by james mcgraw et al at the university of manchester llnl colorado state university and dec it was revised in  and the first compiled implementation was made in  its performance is superior to c and rivals fortran according to some sources combined with efficient and automatic parallelization sisals name came from grepping sal for single assignment language from the unix dictionary usrdictwords versions exist for the cray xmp ymp  sequent encore alliant dec vax dataflow architectures ksr transputers and systolic arrays architecture the requirements for a finegrain parallelism language are better met with a dataflow language than a systems language sisal is more than just a dataflow and finegrain language it was a set of tools that converted a textual human readable dataflow language into a graph format named if  intermediary form  part of the sisal project also involved converting this graph format into runable c code sisal renaissance era sisal saw a brief resurgence in  when a group of undergraduates at worcester polytechnic institute investigated implementing a finegrain parallelism backend for the sisal language
