visual prolog visual prolog also formerly known as pdc prolog and turbo prolog is a strongly typed objectoriented extension of prolog as turbo prolog it was marketed by borland but it is now developed and marketed by the danish firm prolog development center pdc that originally developed it visual prolog can build microsoft windows guiapplications console applications dlls dynamic link libraries and cgiprograms it can also link to com components and to databases by means of odbc logic languages are traditionally interpreted but visual prolog is compiled this provides the important improvement of converting traditional prologtypical runtime errors to compiler warnings which ensures a better robustness of the finished applications the core of visual prolog are horn clauses algebraic datatypes pattern matching and controlled nondeterminism like in traditional prolog but unlike traditional prolog visual prolog has always been strongly and statically typed brief release history version  contains http server and lalr parser generator see also new features in visual prolog  version  can generate  bit windows code see also new features in visual prolog  version  introduced generic classes and interfaces see generic programming guarded monitors see also new features in visual prolog  version  introduced anonymous predicates a logical pendant to anonymous functions and namespaces see also new features in visual prolog  version  introduced parametric polymorphism since version  the language has been fully objectoriented hanoi example in the towers of hanoi example the prolog inference engine figures out how to move a stack of any number of progressively smaller disks one at a time from the left left pole to the right pole right in the described way by means of a center center pole as transit so that theres never a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk the predicate hanoi takes an integer  the number of disks as an initial argument in reallife visual prolog is especially suited for intricate problems such as resource planning etc as the example shows visual prolog can be used for quick programming in the small but it is mostly employed for industrialstrength large applications class hanoi end class hanoi implement hanoi end implement hanoi goal
