grass gis geographic resources analysis support system commonly termed grass gis is a geographic information system gis software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis image processing producing graphics and maps spatial and temporal modeling and visualizing it can handle raster topological vector image processing and graphic data grass gis contains over  modules to render maps and images on monitor and paper manipulate raster and vector data including vector networks process multispectral image data and create manage and store spatial data it is licensed and released as free and opensource software under the gnu general public license gpl it runs on multiple operating systems including  windows and linux users can interface with the software features through a graphical user interface gui or by plugging into grass via other software such as qgis they can also interface with the modules directly through a bespoke shell that the application launches or by calling individual modules directly from a standard shell the latest stable release version lts is grass gis  which is available since  the grass development team is a multinational group consisting of developers at many locations grass is one of the eight initial software projects of the open source geospatial foundation architecture grass supports raster and vector data in two and three dimensions the vector data model is topological meaning that areas are defined by boundaries and centroids boundaries cannot overlap within one layer in contrast opengis simple features defines vectors more freely much as a nongeoreferenced vector illustration program does grass is designed as an environment in which tools that perform specific gis computations are executed unlike guibased application software the grass user is presented with a unix shell containing a modified environment that supports execution of grass commands termed modules the environment has a state that includes parameters such as the geographic region covered and the map projection in use all grass modules read this state and additionally are given specific parameters such as input and output maps or values to use in a computation when executed most grass modules and abilities can be operated via a graphical user interface provided by a grass module as an alternative to manipulating geographic data in a shell the grass distribution includes over  core modules over  addon modules created by users are offered on its website the libraries and core modules are written in c other modules are written in c c python unix shell tcl or other scripting languages the modules are designed under the unix philosophy and hence can be combined using python or shell scripting to build more complex or specialized modules by users without knowledge of c programming there is cooperation between the grass and quantum gis qgis projects recent versions of qgis can be executed within the grass environment allowing qgis to be used as a userfriendly graphical interface to grass that more closely resembles other graphical gis software than does the shellbased grass interface another project exists to reimplement grass in java as jgrass history grass has been under continuous development since  and has involved a large number of federal us agencies universities and private companies the core components of grass and the management of integration of efforts into its releases was originally directed by the us army  construction engineering research laboratory usacerl a branch of the us army corps of engineers in champaign illinois usacerl completed its last release of grass as version  in  and provided five updates and patches to this release through  usacerl also wrote the core components of the grass  floating point version the development of grass was started by the usacerl to meet the need of the united states military for software for land management and environmental planning a key motive was the national environmental policy act the development platform was unix running on vax hardware during  through  usacerl led the development of grass with the involvement of many others including universities and other federal agencies usacerl officially ceased its involvement in grass after release   though development had been limited to minor patches since  a group formed at baylor university to take over the software releasing grass  around this time a port of the software to linux was made in  markus neteler the current project leader announced the release of grass  which offered major improvements including a new graphical user interface in october  the license of the originally public domain software grass software was changed to the gnu gpl in version  since then grass has evolved into a powerful software suite with a wide range of applications in many different areas of scientific research and engineering for example it is used to estimate potential solar photovoltaic yield with rsun as of  grass is used in academic and commercial settings around the world and in many government agencies including nasa noaa usda dlr csiro the national park service the us census bureau usgs and many environmental consulting companies  the latest stable release version lts is grass gis  it was released in  replacing the old stable branch  which was released in  version  added many new features including large data support a fast topological dd vector engine powerful vector network analysis a full temporal framework and many other features and improvements  grass development is split into two branches stable and developmental the stable branch is recommended for most users while the  branch operates as a testbed for new features
