gnu privacy guard gnu privacy guard gnupg or gpg is a free software replacement for symantecs pgp cryptographic software suite gnupg is compliant with rfc  which is the ietf standards track specification of openpgp modern versions of pgp and veridis filecrypt are interoperable with gnupg and other openpgpcompliant systems gnupg is part of the gnu project and has received major funding from the german government overview gnupg is a hybridencryption software program because it uses a combination of conventional symmetrickey cryptography for speed and publickey cryptography for ease of secure key exchange typically by using the recipients public key to encrypt a session key which is only used once this mode of operation is part of the openpgp standard and has been part of pgp from its first version the gnupgx series uses an integrated cryptographic library while the gnupgx series replaces this with libgcrypt gnupg encrypts messages using asymmetric keypairs individually generated by gnupg users the resulting public keys may be exchanged with other users in a variety of ways such as internet key servers they must always be exchanged carefully to prevent identity spoofing by corrupting public key  owner identity correspondences it is also possible to add a cryptographic digital signature to a message so the message integrity and sender can be verified if a particular correspondence relied upon has not been corrupted gnupg also supports symmetric encryption algorithms by default gnupg uses the cast symmetrical algorithm gnupg does not use patented or otherwise restricted software or algorithms instead gnupg uses a variety of other nonpatented algorithms for a long time it did not support the idea encryption algorithm used in pgp it was in fact possible to use idea in gnupg by downloading a plugin for it however this might require a license for some uses in countries in which idea was patented starting with versions  and  gnupg supports idea because the last patent of idea expired in  support of idea is intended to get rid of all the questions from folks either trying to decrypt old data or migrating keys from pgp to gnupg and hence is not recommended for regular use as of versions  and  gnupg supports the following algorithms more recent releases of gnupgx stable and modern series expose most cryptographic functions and algorithms libgcrypt its cryptographic library provides including support for elliptic curve cryptography ecdsa ecdh and eddsa in the modern series ie since gnupg history gnupg was initially developed by werner koch version  which was the first production version was released on september   almost two years after the first gnupg release version  the german federal ministry of economics and technology funded the documentation and the port to microsoft windows in  gnupg is a system compliant to the openpgp standard thus the history of openpgp is of importance it was designed to interoperate with pgp the email encryption program initially designed and developed by phil zimmermann on february   a gnupg crowdfunding effort closed raising  euros for a new web site and infrastructure improvements branches  there are three actively maintained branches of gnupg modern  and stable  cannot be installed at the same time however it is possible to install classic  along with any gnupg x ie modern or stable version before the release of gnupg  all releases originated from a single branch ie before november   no multiple release branches were maintained in parallel these former sequentially succeeding up to  release branches were platforms although the basic gnupg program has a commandline interface there exist various frontends that provide it with a graphical user interface for example gnupg encryption support has been integrated into kmail and evolution the graphical email clients found in kde and gnome the most popular linux desktops there are also graphical gnupg frontends for example seahorse for gnome and kgpg for kde for the osx the macgpg project provides a number of aqua frontends for os integration of encryption and key management as well as gnupg installations via installer packages furthermore the gpgtools installer installs all related openpgp applications gpg keychain access plugins gpgmail and dependencies macgpg to use gnupg based encryption instant messaging applications such as psi and fire can automatically secure messages when gnupg is installed and configured webbased software such as horde also makes use of it the crossplatform extension enigmail provides gnupg support for mozilla thunderbird and seamonkey similarly enigform provides gnupg support for mozilla firefox firegpg was discontinued june   in  g code gmbh and intevation gmbh released gpgwin a software suite that includes gnupg for windows gnu privacy assistant and gnupg plugins for windows explorer and outlook these tools are wrapped in a standard windows installer making it easier for gnupg to be installed and used on windows systems limitations as a commandlinebased system gnupgx is not written as an api that may be incorporated into other software to overcome this gpgme abbreviated from gnupg made easy was created as an api wrapper around gnupg that parses the output of gnupg and provides a stable and maintainable api between the components this currently requires an outofprocess call to the gnupg executable for many gpgme api calls as a result possible security problems in an application do not propagate to the actual crypto code due to the process barrier various graphical frontends based on gpgme have been created since gnupg many of gnupgs functions are available directly as c apis in libgcrypt vulnerabilities the openpgp standard specifies several methods of digitally signing messages in  due to an error in a change to gnupg intended to make one of those methods more efficient a security vulnerability was introduced it affected only one method of digitally signing messages only for some releases of gnupg  through  and there were fewer than  such keys listed on the key servers most people did not use this method and were in any case discouraged from doing so so the damage caused if any since none has been publicly reported would appear to have been minimal support for this method has been removed from gnupg versions released after this discovery  and later two further vulnerabilities were discovered in early  the first being that scripted uses of gnupg for signature verification may result in false positives the second that nonmime messages were vulnerable to the injection of data which while not covered by the digital signature would be reported as being part of the signed message in both cases updated versions of gnupg were made available at the time of the announcement application support notable applications frontends and browser extensions that support gpg include the following in popular culture in may  the washington post reported on a minute video guide gpg for journalists posted to vimeo in january  by a user named anon the post identified anon as fugitive nsa whistleblower edward snowden who it said made the tutorialnarrated by a digitally disguised voice whose speech patterns sound similar to those of snowdento teach journalist glenn greenwald email encryption greenwald said that he could not confirm the authorship of the video
