sablevm sablevm was a clean room implementation of java bytecode interpreter implementing the java virtual machine vm specification second edition sablevm was designed to be a robust extremely portable efficient and fully specificationscompliant jvm spec java native interface invocation interface debug interface etc java virtual machine that would be easy to maintain and to extend it is now no longer being maintained the implementation was a part of the effort in the early s to break the java ecosystem free from sun microsystemss control overview the core engine is an interpreter which used groundbreaking techniques to deliver performance that can approach that of a naive justintime jit compiler while retaining the software engineering advantages of interpreters portability maintainability and simplicity this simplicity makes sablevms source code very accessible and easy to understand for new usersprogrammers sablevm is free software  it is licensed under the gnu lesser general public license lgpl it also makes use of gnu classpath copyrighted by the fsf which is licensed under the gnu general public license with linking exception sablevm is the first open source virtual machine for java to include the support for jvmdi java virtual machine debugging interface and jdwp java debug wire protocol these standard java debugging interfaces are used for example by eclipse to provide a rich and userfriendly java development environment java intermediate language some versions of the sablevm use java intermediate language an intermediate language which is a subset of xml representing the type structure of a java program the language was proposed by the team of sablevm in mcgill university in january  to aid the analysis of a java program with the goals of scalability and good performance the language has not been widely adopted consider the following piece of java code this piece can be expressed in the language as follows
