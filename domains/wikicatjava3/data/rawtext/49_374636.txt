adobe coldfusion adobe coldfusion is a commercial rapid web application development platform created by jj allaire in  the programming language used with that platform is also commonly called coldfusion though is more accurately known as cfml coldfusion was originally designed to make it easier to connect simple html pages to a database by version   it became a full platform that included an ide in addition to a full scripting language overview one of the distinguishing features of coldfusion is its associated scripting language coldfusion markup language cfml cfml compares to the scripting components of asp jsp and php in purpose and features but its tag syntax more closely resembles html while its script syntax resembles javascript coldfusion is often used synonymously with cfml but there are additional cfml application servers besides coldfusion and coldfusion supports programming languages other than cfml such as serverside actionscript and embedded scripts that can be written in a javascriptlike language known as cfscript originally a product of allaire and released on july   coldfusion was developed by brothers joseph j jj and jeremy allaire in  allaire was acquired by macromedia which in turn was acquired by adobe systems inc in  coldfusion is most often used for datadriven websites or intranets but can also be used to generate remote services such as soap web services or flash remoting it is especially wellsuited as the serverside technology to the clientside flex coldfusion can also handle asynchronous events such as sms and instant messaging via its gateway interface available in coldfusion mx  enterprise edition main features coldfusion provides a number of additional features out of the box among them main things are other implementations of cfml offer similar or enhanced functionality such as running in a net environment or image manipulation the engine was written in c and featured among other things a builtin scripting language cfscript plugin modules written in java and a syntax very similar to html the equivalent to an html element a coldfusion tag begins with the letters cf followed by a name that is indicative of what the tag is interpreted to in html eg to begin the output of variables or other content in addition to cfscript and plugins as described cfstudio provided a design platform with a wysiwyg display in addition to coldfusion cfstudio also supports syntax in other languages popular for backend programming such as perl in addition to making backend functionality easily available to the nonprogrammer version  and forward in particular integrated easily with the apache web server and with internet information services other features all versions of coldfusion prior to  were written using microsoft visual c this meant that coldfusion was largely limited to running on microsoft windows although allaire did successfully port coldfusion to sun solaris starting with version  the allaire company was sold to macromedia then macromedia was sold to adobe earlier versions were not as robust as the versions available from version  forward with the release of coldfusion mx  the engine had been rewritten in java and supported its own runtime environment which was easily replaced through its configuration options with the runtime environment from sun version  included the ability to code and debug shockwave flash versions cold fusion  version  brought about a port to the sun solaris operating system cold fusion studio gained a live page preview and html syntax checker coldfusion  cold fusion moniker renamed simply as coldfusion  possibly to distinguish it from cold fusion theory coldfusion  version  brought the ability to natively invoke java objects execute system commands and talk directly to a java ee server coldfusion  first release from macromedia after the allaire corporation acquisition the last to be legacy coded for a specific platform on january   allaire announced a pending merger with macromedia macromedia continued its development and released the product under the name coldfusion  it retained the name coldfusion through the remainder of version  releases coldfusion mx  prior to  edwin smith an allaire architect on jrun and later the flash player initiated a project codenamed neo this project was later revealed as a coldfusion server rewritten completely using java this made portability easier and provided a layer of security on the server because it ran inside a java runtime environment in june  macromedia released the version  product under a slightly different name coldfusion mx allowing the product to be associated with both the macromedia brand and its original branding coldfusion mx was completely rebuilt from the ground up and was based on the java ee platform coldfusion mx was also designed to integrate well with macromedia flash using flash remoting with the release of coldfusion mx the cfml language api was released with an oop interface coldfusion mx  with the release of coldfusion  on february   the naming convention was amended rendering the product name macromedia coldfusion mx  the codename for cfmx was blackstone cfmx  added flashbased and xformsbased web forms and a report builder that output in adobe pdf as well as flashpaper rtf and excel the adobe pdf output is also available as a wrapper to any html page converting that page to a quality printable document the enterprise edition also added gateways these provide interaction with nonhttp request services such as im services sms directory watchers and an asynchronous execution xml support was boosted in this version to include native schema checking coldfusion mx  codename merrimack added support for mac os x improvements to flash forms rtf support for cfreport the new cfcproxy feature for javacfc integration and more coldfusion mx  codenamed mystic included advanced features for working with adobe flex  as well as more improvements for the cf report builder adobe coldfusion  on july   adobe systems released coldfusion  dropping mx from its name during beta testing the codename used was scorpio the eighth sign of the zodiac and the eighth iteration of coldfusion as a commercial product more than  developers worldwide were active in the beta process  many more testers than the  adobe systems originally expected the coldfusion development team consisted of developers based in newtonboston massachusetts and offshore in bangalore india some of the new features are the cfpdfform tag which enables integration with adobe acrobat forms some image manipulation functions microsoft net integration and the cfpresentation tag which allows the creation of dynamic presentations using adobe acrobat connect the webbased collaboration solution formerly known as macromedia breeze in addition the coldfusion administrator for the enterprise version ships with builtin server monitoring coldfusion  is available on several operating systems including linux mac os x and windows server  other additions to coldfusion  are builtin ajax widgets file archive manipulation cfzip microsoft exchange server integration cfexchange image manipulation including automatic captcha generation cfimage multithreading perapplication settings atom and rss feeds reporting enhancements stronger encryption libraries array and structure improvements improved database interaction extensive performance improvements pdf manipulation and merging capabilities cfpdf interactive debugging embedded database support with apache derby and a more ecmascript compliant cfscript for development of coldfusion applications several tools are available primarily adobe dreamweaver cs macromedia homesite x cfeclipse eclipse and others tag updaters are available for these applications to update their support for the new coldfusion  features adobe coldfusion  coldfusion  codenamed centaur was released on october   new features for cf include adobe coldfusion  coldfusion  codenamed zeus was released on may   new or improved features available in all editions standard enterprise and developer include but are not limited to additional new or improved features in coldfusion enterprise or developer editions include but are not limited to the lists above were obtained from the adobe web site pages describing new features as listed first in the links in the following list for additional information on new features see cf was originally referred to by the codename zeus after first being confirmed as coming by adobe at adobe max  and during much of its prerelease period it was also commonly referred to as coldfusion next and coldfusion x in blogs on twitter etc before adobe finally confirmed it would be coldfusion  for much of  coldfusion product manager adam lehman toured the us setting up countless meetings with customers developers and user groups to formulate a master blueprint for the next feature set in september  he presented the plans to adobe where they were given full support and approval by upper management the first public beta of coldfusion  was released via adobe labs on  february  adobe coldfusion  coldfusion  codenamed splendor was released on april   coldfusion  has actually removed many features previously identified in earlier releases as deprecated or no longer supported usually you could continue to use a certain tag or function this is no longer the case for example changes to the cflog tag that were deprecated will cause an error condition in cf and not in cf adobe coldfusion  release adobe coldfusion  release codenamed raijin was released on february   adobe coldfusion  coldfusion  codenamed aether the next version of coldfusion server post raijin has been codenamed aether aether is the greek god of upper atmosphere development roadmap on august   adobe announced via their official coldfusion blog the new roadmap for coldfusion including the code names splendor thunder and dazzle for the next two release versions adobe announced new features for coldfusion including but not limited to mobile  streamlined mobile application development revamped and new pdf functionalities enabling enterprise to easily integrate with social media streams enterprise mobility support for responsive multi screen content digital marketing  web mobile  social analytics and customizable enterprise video portal adobe also announced in the same roadmap upcoming cloud enhancements the roadmap projects coldfusion development out to the year  features rich forms coldfusion server includes a subset of its macromedia flex  technology its stated purpose is to allow for rich forms in html pages using cfml to generate flash movies these flash forms can be used to implement rich internet applications but with limited efficiency due to the actionscript restrictions in place on flash forms by macromedia flash forms also provide additional widgets for data input such as date pickers and data grids in previous versions of coldfusion some form validation and additional widgets were available using a combination of java applets and javascript this option persists for those who do not wish to use flash however not all features are supported an example coldfusion also includes some xforms capability and the ability to skin forms using xslt pdf and flashpaper generation coldfusion can generate pdf or flashpaper documents using standard html ie no additional coding is needed to generate documents for print cfml authors place html and css within a pair of cfdocument tags and specify the desired format flashpaper or pdf the generated document can then either be saved to disk or sent to the clients browser coldfusion  has now introduced the cfpdf tag which allows for control over pdf documents including pdf forms and merging of pdfs these tags however do not use adobes pdf engine but a combination of the commercial jpedal java pdf library and the free and open source java library itext coldfusion components objects coldfusion was originally not an objectoriented programming language like php versions  and below coldfusion falls into the category of oo languages that do not support multiple inheritance along with java smalltalk etc with the mx release  coldfusion introduced basic oo functionality with the component language construct which resembles classes in oo languages each component may contain any number of properties and methods one component may also extend another inheritance components only support single inheritance object handling feature set and performance enhancing has occurred with subsequent releases with the release of coldfusion  javastyle interfaces are supported coldfusion components use the file extension cfc to differentiate them from coldfusion templates cfm remoting component methods may be made available as web services with no additional coding and configuration all that is required is for a methods access to be declared remote coldfusion automatically generates a wsdl at the url for the component in this manner httppathtocomponentscomponentcfcwsdl aside from soap the services are offered in flash remoting binary format methods which are declared remote may also be invoked via an http get or post request consider the get request as shown this will invoke the components search function passing your query and strict as arguments this type of invocation is wellsuited for ajaxenabled applications coldfusion  introduced the ability to serialize coldfusion data structures to json for consumption on the client the coldfusion server will automatically generate documentation for a component if you navigate to its url and insert the appropriate code within the components declarations this is an application of component introspection available to developers of coldfusion components access to a components documentation requires a password a developer can view the documentation for all components known to the coldfusion server by navigating to the coldfusion url this interface resembles the javadoc html documentation for java classes custom tags coldfusion provides several ways to implement custom markup language tags ie those not included in the core coldfusion language these are especially useful for providing a familiar interface for web designers and content authors familiar with html but not imperative programming the traditional and most common way is using cfml a standard cfml page can be interpreted as a tag with the tag name corresponding to the file name prefixed with cf for example the file imapcfm can be used as the tag cfimap attributes used within the tag are available in the attributes scope of the tag implementation page cfml pages are accessible in the same directory as the calling page via a special directory in the coldfusion web application or via a cfimport tag in the calling page the latter method does not necessarily require the cf prefix for the tag name a second way is the development of cfx tags using java or c cfx tags are prefixed with cfx for example cfximap tags are added to the coldfusion runtime environment using the coldfusion administrator where jar or dll files are registered as custom tags finally coldfusion supports jsp tag libraries from the jsp  language specification jsp tags are included in cfml pages using the cfimport tag currently alternative server platforms generally support coldfusion  functionality with minor changes or feature enhancements interactions with other programming languages coldfusion and java the standard coldfusion installation allows the deployment of coldfusion as a war file or ear file for deployment to standalone application servers such as macromedia jrun and ibm websphere coldfusion can also be deployed to servlet containers such as apache tomcat and mortbay jetty but because these platforms do not officially support coldfusion they leave many of its features inaccessible as of coldfusion  macromedia jrun was replaced by apache tomcat because coldfusion is a java ee application coldfusion code can be mixed with java classes to create a variety of applications and use existing java libraries coldfusion has access to all underlying java classes supports jsp custom tag libraries and can access jsp functions after retrieving the jsp page context getpagecontext prior to coldfusion  coldfusion components could only be used by java or net by declaring them as web services however beginning in coldfusion mx  coldfusion components can now be used directly within java classes using the cfcproxy class recently there has been much interest in java development using alternate languages such as jython groovy and jruby coldfusion was one of the first scripting platforms to allow this style of java development coldfusion and net coldfusion  natively supports net within the cfml syntax coldfusion developers can simply call any net assembly without needing to recompile or alter the assemblies in any way data types are automatically translated between coldfusion and net example net datatable  coldfusion query a unique feature for a java ee vendor coldfusion  offers the ability to access net assemblies remotely through proxy without the use of net remoting this allows coldfusion users to leverage net without having to be installed on a windows operating system acronyms the acronym for the coldfusion markup language is cfml when coldfusion templates are saved to disk they are traditionally given the extension cfm or cfml the cfc extension is used for coldfusion components the original extension was dbm or dbml which stood for database markup language when talking about coldfusion most users use the acronym cf and this is used for numerous coldfusion resources such as user groups cfugs and sites cfmx is the common abbreviation for coldfusion versions  and  aka coldfusion mx alternative server environments coldfusion originated as proprietary technology based on web technology industry standards however it is becoming a less closed technology through the availability of competing products such alternative products include in alphabetical order the argument can be made that coldfusion is even less platformbound than raw java ee or net simply because coldfusion will run on top of a net app server new atlanta or on top of any servlet container or java ee application server jrun websphere jboss geronimo tomcat resin server jetty web server etc in theory a coldfusion application could be moved unchanged from a java ee application server to a net application server vulnerabilities in march  a known issue affecting coldfusion   and  left the national vulnerability database open to attack the vulnerability had been identified and a patch released by adobe for cf and cf in january in april  a coldfusion vulnerability was blamed by linode for an intrusion into the linode manager control panel website a security bulletin and hotfix for this had been issued by adobe a week earlier in may  adobe identified another critical vulnerability reportedly already being exploited in the wild which targets all recent versions of coldfusion on any servers where the webbased administrator and api have not been locked down the vulnerability allows unauthorized users to upload malicious scripts and potentially gain full control over the server a security bulletin and hotfix for this was issued by adobe  days later this is currently the only known vulnerability for coldfusion  and coldfusion  currently supported versions in april  there was reported a crosssite scripting xss vulnerability in adobe coldfusion  before update  and in coldfusion  before update  that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or html however its exploitable only by users who have authenticated through the administration panel
