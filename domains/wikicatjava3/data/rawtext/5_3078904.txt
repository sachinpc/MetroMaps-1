spec sharp spec is a programming language with specification language features that extends the capabilities of the c programming language with eiffellike contracts including object invariants preconditions and postconditions like escjava it includes a static checking tool based on a theorem prover that is able to statically verify many of these invariants it also includes a variety of other minor extensions to the language such as nonnull reference types the code contracts api in the net framework  has evolved with spec microsoft research developed both spec and c in turn spec serves as the foundation of the sing programming language which microsoft research also developed features spec extends the core c programming language with features such as example this example shows two of the basic structures that are used when adding contracts to your code try spec in your browser sing sharp sing sharp or sing is a superset of spec sharp microsoft research developed spec and later extended it into sing in order to develop the singularity operating system sing augments the capabilities of spec with support for channels and lowlevel programming language constructs which are necessary for implementing system software sing is typesafe the semantics of messagepassing primitives in sing are defined by formal and written contracts
