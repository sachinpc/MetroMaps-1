spidermonkey spidermonkey is the code name for the firstever javascript engine written by brendan eich at netscape communications later released as open source and currently maintained by the mozilla foundation spidermonkey provides javascript support for mozilla firefox and various embeddings such as the gnome  desktop history eich wrote javascript in ten days in  having been recruited to netscape with the promise of doing scheme in the browser the idea of using scheme was abandoned when engineering management decided that the language must look like java in the fall of  eich needing to pay off the substantial technical debt left from the first year stayed home for two weeks to rewrite mocha as the codebase that became known as spidermonkey the name spidermonkey may have been chosen as a reference to the movie beavis and butthead do america in which the character tom anderson mentions that the title characters were whacking off like a couple of spider monkeys in  eich transferred management of the spidermonkey code to dave mandelin tracemonkey tracemonkey was the first jit compiler written for the javascript language the compiler was first released as part of spidermonkey in firefox  providing performance improvements ranging between  and  times faster than the baseline interpreter in firefox  instead of compiling whole functions tracemonkey was a tracing jit which operates by recording control flow and data types during interpreter execution this data then informed the construction of trace trees highly specialized paths of native code improvements to jgermonkey eventually made tracemonkey obsolete especially with the development of the spidermonkey type inference engine tracemonkey is absent from spidermonkey from firefox  onward jgermonkey jgermonkey internally named methodjit was a wholemethod jit compiler designed to improve performance in cases where tracemonkey could not generate stable native code it was first released in firefox  and eventually entirely supplanted tracemonkey it has itself been replaced by ionmonkey jgermonkey operated very differently from other compilers in its class while typical compilers worked by constructing and optimizing a control flow graph representing the function jgermonkey instead operated by iterating linearly forward through spidermonkey bytecode the internal function representation although this prohibits optimizations that require instruction reordering jgermonkey compiling has the advantage of being very fast which is useful for javascript since recompiling due to changing variable types is frequent mozilla implemented a number of critical optimizations in jgermonkey most importantly polymorphic inline caches and type inference the difference between tracemonkey and jgermonkey jit techniques and the need for both was explained in a hacksmozillaorg article a more indepth explanation of the technical details was provided by chris leary one of spidermonkeys developers in a blog post more technical information can be found in other developers blogs dvander dmandelin standards spidermonkey implements ecma edition  ecmascript and several added features ecma ecmascript for xml ex was dropped in early  even though spidermonkey is used in firefox it does not provide host environments such as document object model dom in mozilla projects that support the dom gecko provides the host environment internals spidermonkey is written in cc and contains an interpreter the ionmonkey jit compiler and a garbage collector ionmonkey ionmonkey is the name of mozillas current javascript jit compiler which aims to enable many new optimizations that were impossible with the prior jgermonkey architecture ionmonkey is a more traditional compiler it translates spidermonkey bytecode into a control flow graph using static single assignment form ssa for the intermediate representation this architecture enables wellknown optimizations from other programming languages to be used for javascript including type specialization function inlining linearscan register allocation dead code elimination and loopinvariant code motion the compiler can emit fast native code translations of javascript functions on the arm x and x platforms it is the default engine since firefox  odinmonkey odinmonkey is the name of mozillas new optimization module for asmjs an easily compilable subset of javascript odinmonkey itself is not a jit compiler it uses the current jit compiler its included with firefox from release  use spidermonkey is intended to be embedded in other applications that provide host environments for javascript an incomplete list follows spidermonkey includes a javascript shell for interactive javascript development and for commandline invocation of javascript program files several large organizations use spidermonkey to manage their javascript for frontend applications
