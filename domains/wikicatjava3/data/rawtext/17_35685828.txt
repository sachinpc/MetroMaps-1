foswiki foswiki is an enterprise wiki typically used to run a collaboration platform knowledge base or document management system users can create wiki applications using the topic markup language tml and developers can extend its functionality with plugins the foswiki project was launched in october  when a dispute about the future direction of twiki could not be settled resulting in the decision of nearly all key twiki contributors to fork since then the codebases have diverged significantly however foswiki continues to maintain compatibility with content written for twiki foswiki stands for free and open source wiki to emphasize its commitment to open source software the project is governed by the foswiki association ev a volunteer run nonprofit foundation the foswiki website is seen by some as one of the more popular perlrelated websites based upon alexa rankings of all websites in the world features foswiki features an open architecture programmed and implemented in the perl and javascript languages and runs on standard web servers such as apache and lighttpd with almost  contributors providing over  commits since its inception the foswiki team not only develops the code but also offers online support including on irc core features include a tinymce wysiwyg editor builtin search engine default text database and skinnable user interface as well as rssatom feeds email support and database interfaces to support scalable database solutions such as mongodb and mysql additional securityrelated features include an auditable version control system user authentication an access control system crosssite request forgery protection and improved spamprevention extensions extensions users have contributed over  extensions most of these extensions have been developed by or for corporate users and are maintained by developers and users as documented in the individual extension histories extensions have been developed to link into databases create charts tags sort tables write spreadsheets create image gallery and slideshows make drawings write blogs plot graphs interface to many different authentication schemes including single signon track extreme programming projects and others application platform foswiki is a structured wiki that acts as an application platform for webbased applications specifically it provides databaselike manipulation of fields stored on pages and offers a sqllike query language to support the embedding reports in wiki pages wiki applications are often called situational applications because they are created adhoc by users for very specific needs for example users have built foswiki applications that include call center status boards todo lists inventory systems employee handbooks bug trackers blog applications discussion forums status reports with rollups and more user interface the user interface is customizable through use of templates themes and css it includes support for internationalization with support for multiple character sets utf urls etc the english user interface has been translated by users into bulgarian chinese czech danish dutch french german greek italian japanese korean norwegian polish portuguese russian spanish swedish turkish and klingon deployment foswiki is expected to be used primarily at the workplace as a corporate wiki to coordinate team activities track projects implement workflows and as an intranet wiki for example in academia foswiki among other components was used in several research programs including data integration platform for systems biology collaborations an interactive data integration platform supporting collaborative research projects based on foswiki solrlucene and custom helper applications implementation foswiki is implemented in perl and javascript using jquery though it can be used without javascript being enabled in the browser by default wiki pages are stored on the server in plain text files everything including metadata such as access control settings are version controlled using rcs rcs is optional since an allperl version control system is provided other serverside databases such as mongodb are supported through use of extensions informal user reports suggest that foswiki scales reasonably well even though it uses plain text files and no relational database to store page data especially where load balancing and caching are used to improve performance support foswiki is an entirely communitydriven project and has no controlling commercial interest behind it user support is provided by the community via the mechanisms of irc and the main website history foswiki started life as a fork of the twiki project since the fork it has been worked on continuously by a relatively large development team notable developments since the fork include adoption of the jquery javascript user interface framework interfacing to the mongodb nosql database interfacing to the solr search system page caching and a modified editing interface
