maple software maple is a symbolic and numeric computing environment and multiparadigm programming language developed by maplesoft maple also covers other aspects of technical computing including visualization data analysis matrix computation and connectivity a toolbox maplesim adds functionality for multidomain physical modeling and code generation overview core functionality users can enter mathematics in traditional mathematical notation custom user interfaces can also be created there is support for numeric computations to arbitrary precision as well as symbolic computation and visualization examples of symbolic computations are given below maple incorporates a dynamically typed imperativestyle programming language which resembles pascal the language permits variables of lexical scope there are also interfaces to other languages c c fortran java matlab and visual basic there is also an interface to excel maple supports mathml  a wc format for representing and interpreting mathematical expressions including their display in web pages architecture maple is based on a small kernel written in c which provides the maple language most functionality is provided by libraries which come from a variety of sources most of the libraries are written in the maple language these have viewable source code many numerical computations are performed by the nag numerical libraries atlas libraries or gmp libraries different functionality in maple requires numerical data in different formats symbolic expressions are stored in memory as directed acyclic graphs the standard interface and calculator interface are written in java history the first concept of maple arose from a meeting in november  at the university of waterloo researchers at the university wished to purchase a computer powerful enough to run macsyma instead it was decided that they would develop their own computer algebra system that would be able to run on lower cost computers the first limited version appearing in december  with maple demonstrated first at conferences beginning in  the name is a reference to maples canadian heritage by the end of  over  universities had copies of maple installed on their machines in  the research group arranged with watcom products inc to license and distribute maple in  waterloo maple inc was founded the companys original goal was to manage the distribution of the software eventually the company evolved to have an rd department where most of maples development is done today with the rest done at university research labs worldwide including the symbolic computation laboratory at the university of waterloo and the ontario research centre for computer algebra at the university of western ontario in  the first graphical user interface for maple was developed and included with version  for the macintosh x and windows versions of the new interface followed in  with maple v in  a special issue of a newsletter created by maple developers called mapletech was published in  with the release of maple  maple included some of the nag numerical libraries in  the current standard interface was introduced with maple  this interface is primarily written in java although portions such as the rules for typesetting mathematical formulae are written in the maple language the java interface was criticized for being slow improvements have been made in later versions although the maple documentation recommends the previous classic interface for users with less than mb of physical memory this classic interface is no longer being maintained between the mid  and  maple lost significant market share to competitors due to a weaker user interface in  maple  introduced a new document mode as part of the standard interface the main feature of this mode is that math is entered using two dimensional input in  maple  added additional user interface features found in mathematica including special purpose style sheets control of headers and footers bracket matching auto execution regions command completion templates syntax checking and autoinitialization regions additional features were added for making maple easier to use as a matlab toolbox maple  introduced a flythrough feature for animating d plots in september  maple and maplesoft were acquired by the japanese software retailer cybernet systems in  the maple workbook was introduced which is a container format for storing maple documents and data into a single file examples of maple code sample imperative programming constructs simple functions can also be defined using the maps to arrow notation integration find answer determinant compute the determinant of a matrix series expansion seriestanhxx solve equation numerically high

engine is used within several other products from maplesoft listed below are thirdparty commercial products that no longer use the maple engine
