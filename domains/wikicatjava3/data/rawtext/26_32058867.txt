following years koum relied on his  savings from yahoo in january  after purchasing an iphone and realizing that the sevenmonthold app store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps he started visiting his friend alex fishman in west san jose where the three would discuss having statuses next to individual names of the people but this was not possible without an iphone developer so fishman introduced koum to igor solomennikov a developer in russia that he had found on rentacodercom koum almost immediately chose the name whatsapp because it sounded like whats up and a week later on his birthday on february   he incorporated whatsapp inc in california however early whatsapp kept crashing or getting stuck and at a particular point koum felt like giving up and looking for a new job upon which acton encouraged him to wait for a few more months in june  apple launched push notifications letting developers ping users when they were not using an app koum updated whatsapp so that each time the user changed their statuses it would ping everyone in the users network whatsapp  was released with a messaging component and the active users suddenly swelled to  koum visited acton who was still unemployed while managing another startup and decided to join the company in october acton persuaded five exyahoo friends to invest  in seed funding and as a result was granted cofounder status and a stake he officially joined on november  after months at beta stage the application eventually launched in november  exclusively on the app store for the iphone koum then hired an old friend who lived in los angeles chris peiffer to make the blackberry version which arrived two months later whatsapp was switched from a free to paid service to avoid growing too fast mainly because

zuckerberg said that facebooks acquisition of whatsapp was closely related to the internetorg vision according to a techcrunch article zuckerbergs vision for internetorg was as follows the idea he said is to develop a group of basic internet services that would be free of charge to use  a  for the internet these could be a social networking service like facebook a messaging service maybe search and other things like weather providing a bundle of these free of charge to users will work like a gateway drug of sorts  users who may be able to afford data services and phones these days just dont see the point of why they would pay for those data services this would give them some context for why they are important and that will lead them to paying for more services like this  or so the hope goes on may   the government of iran announced that it had proposed to block the access to whatsapp service to iranian residents the reason for this is the assumption of whatsapp by the facebook founder mark zuckerberg who is an american zionist said abdolsamad khorramabadi head of the countrys committee on internet crimes subsequently iranian president hassan rouhani issued an order to the

which will be synced with a users mobile device is available for download on the website it supports os versions of windows  and os x  and higher technical whatsapp uses a customized version of the open standard extensible messaging and presence protocol xmpp upon installation it creates a user account using ones phone number as the username jabber id codice whatsapp software automatically compares all the phone numbers from the devices address book with its central database of whatsapp users to automatically add contacts to the users whatsapp contact list previously the android and nokia series  versions used an mdhashed reversedversion of the phones imei as password while the ios version used the phones wifi mac address instead of imei a  update now generates a random password on the server side some dual sim devices may not be compatible with whatsapp though there are some workarounds for this in january  whatsapp introduced a voice calling feature this helped whatsapp to attract a completely different segment of the user population multimedia messages are sent by uploading the image audio or video to be sent to an http server and then sending a link to the content along with its base encoded thumbnail if applicable whatsapp follows a store and forward mechanism for exchanging messages between two users when a user sends a message it first travels to the whatsapp server where it is stored then the server repeatedly requests the receiver acknowledge receipt of the message as soon as the message is acknowledged the server drops the message it is no longer available in database of server whatsapp server keeps the message only for  days in its database when it is not delivered when the receiver is not active on whatsapp for  days endtoend encryption on november   open whisper systems announced a partnership with whatsapp to provide endtoend encryption by incorporating the encryption protocol used in signal into each whatsapp client platform open whisper systems said that they had already incorporated the protocol into the latest whatsapp client for android and that support for other clients groupmedia messages and key verification would be coming soon after whatsapp confirmed the partnership to reporters but there was no announcement or documentation about the encryption feature on the official website and further requests for comment were declined in april  german magazine heise security used arp spoofing to confirm that the protocol had been implemented for androidtoandroid messages and that whatsapp messages from or to iphones running ios were still not endtoend encrypted they expressed the concern that regular whatsapp users still could not tell the difference between endtoend encrypted messages and regular messages on april   whatsapp and open whisper systems announced that they had finished adding endtoend encryption to every form of communication on whatsapp and that users could now verify each others keys users were also given the option to enable a trust on first use mechanism in order to be notified if a correspondents key changes according to a white paper that was released along with the announcement whatsapp messages are encrypted with the signal protocol whatsapp calls are encrypted with srtp and all clientserver communications are layered within a separate encrypted channel the signal protocol library used by whatsapp is opensource and published under the gplv license cade metz writing in wired said whatsapp more than any company before it has taken encryption to the masses security concerns on may th  an unconfirmed security researcher from the netherlands under the pseudonym whatsapphack published to the dutch websites tweakersnet and geenstijl a method by which whatsapp accounts could be hijacked the researcher noticed a flaw in the authentication process which allowed the researcher to hijack an account by trying to login with another phone number and intercepting the verification sms text message that under specific conditions remained in the outbox of the symbian phone after the whatsapp client would attempt to send it to itself on android the verification message could be obtained through reading the radio with a tool named logcat the researcher would then copy and send the intercepted verification message to the real number of the phone using an sms gateway to spoof the sender phone number to the number the researcher tried to maliciously login with this method worked and whatsapp issued a patch within one day after publication of the articles to both the android and symbian clients whatsapp did have a security mechanism by design which would disable the account on the phone of the original owner of the phone number when they had a whatsapp account in may  another security hole was reported which left communication through whatsapp susceptible to packet analysis whatsapp communications were not encrypted and data was sent and received in plaintext meaning messages could easily be read if packet traces were available in may  security researchers noticed that new updates of whatsapp no longer sent messages as plaintext but the cryptographic method implemented was subsequently described as broken in august  the whatsapp support staff said that messages were encrypted in the latest version of the whatsapp software for ios and android but not blackberry windows phone and symbian without specifying the cryptographic method on january   an unknown hacker published a website that made it possible to change the status of an arbitrary whatsapp user as long as the phone number was known to make it work it only required a restart of the app according to the hacker it was only one of many security problems in whatsapp on january  whatsapp reported that it had resolved the problem although the only measure actually taken was to block the websites ip address as a reaction a windows tool was made available for download providing the same functionality this problem has since been resolved in the form of an ip address check on currently loggedin sessions german tech site the h demonstrated how to use whatsapi to hijack any whatsapp account on september   shortly after a legal threat to whatsapis developers was alleged characterized by the h as an apparent reaction to security reports and whatsapis source code was taken down for some days the whatsapi team has since returned to active development on december   indrajeet bhuyan and saurav kar both years old demonstrated the whatsapp message handler vulnerability which allows anyone to remotely crash whatsapp just by sending a specially crafted message of kb in size to escape the problem the user who receives the specially crafted message has to delete hisher whole conversation and start a fresh chat because opening the message keeps on crashing whatsapp unless the chat is deleted completely in early  after whatsapp launched a web client that can be used from the browser bhuyan also found that it had two security issues that compromised user privacy the whatsapp photo privacy bug and the whatsapp web photo sync bug on march   whatsapp introduced its documentsharing feature initially allowing users to share pdf files with their contacts however whatsapps default state of automatically downloading attachments raised some concerns in the press about risk and security once support for document sharing expanded beyond pdf files privacy concerns a major privacy and security problem has been the subject of a joint canadiandutch government investigation the primary concern was that whatsapp required users to upload their mobile phones entire address book to whatsapp servers so that whatsapp could discover who among the users contacts was available via whatsapp while this was a fast and convenient way to quickly find and connect the user with contacts who were also using whatsapp it meant that their address book was then mirrored on the whatsapp servers including contact information for contacts who were not using whatsapp this information which consisted solely of phone numbers without any additional information such as the name of the contact was stored in hashed though not salted form late  the dutch government released a pressstatement claiming that whatsapp had changed its hashing method making it much harder to reverse and thus now fully complies with all rules and regulations a user does not need to send a friend request to send messages to another user due to the contact discovery mentioned above in november  whatsapp introduced a feature named read receipts which alerts senders when their messages are read by recipients within a week whatsapp introduced an update allowing users to disable this feature so that message recipients do not send acknowledgements in february  a dutch university student named maikel zweerink published an app that set out to prove that anyone could track a whatsapp users status and also keep an eye of their changing profile pictures privacy settings or status messages regardless of their privacy settings in august  whatsapp announced that it will start sharing account information with facebook consisting of the phone number of the account owner and aggregated analytical data the address books and metadata of users are not shared according to whatsapp this account information is shared to track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on whatsapp and by connecting your phone number with facebooks systems facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them this means that facebook can target advertisements on the facebook platform better by making links between users based on the phone numbers and make friend suggestions to its users based on whatsapps data user data will not be shared with advertisers and is only used internally on the facebook services whatsapp emphasizes the content of user messages is still kept private thanks to its endtoend encryption which means whatsapp cannot read the content of chats however users are given the choice to optout of sharing this data with facebook for advertisement purposes reception security and privacy on march   the saudi arabian communications and information technology commission citc issued a statement regarding possible measures against whatsapp among other applications unless the service providers took serious steps to comply with monitoring and privacy regulations in february  the public authority for data privacy of the german state of schleswigholstein advised against using whatsapp as the service lacked privacy protection such as endtoend client side encryption technology whatsapp started implementing endtoend encryption in late  and finished in april  from april   endtoend encryption for all users communications including file transfers and voice calls is supported for users of the latest client encryption being enabled by default it uses curve for key exchange hkdf for generation of session keys aes in cbc mode for encryption and hmacsha for integrity verification and sha for generating the two  digit finger prints of both users identity keys so they can verify each other as needed even the company would be unable to decrypt users communications amnesty international and security professionals praised the move the us federal bureau of investigation criticised it as threatening the work of law enforcement telegram another messaging service is reported by the bbc to be used by islamic state extremists whatsapp is not the only messaging service that provides endtoend encryption among others threema wickr signal silent phone and line also provide such encryption by default imessage and viber provide it under special circumstances telegram provides endtoend encryption as an optin feature but does not support endtoend encrypted group messaging  whatsapp has a score of  out of  points on the electronic frontier foundations secure messaging scorecard it has received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesnt have access to allowing users to verify contacts identities having past messages secure if the encryption keys are stolen having completed a recent independent security audit and having the security designs properly documented it is missing a point because the code is not open to independent review brazilian court orders on december   mobile providers in brazil were ordered to block whatsapp for  hours the ban was ordered for the services failure to cooperate with criminal court orders in july and august  the following morning however a judge from the appeals court ordered that the ban be lifted for being an unreasonable response recommending that the company be fined instead following the ban but prior to its reversal facebook ceo mark zuckerberg responded by stating that he was stunned that our efforts to protect peoples data would result in such an extreme decision by a single judge to punish every person in brazil who uses whatsapp we hope the brazilian courts quickly reverse course the competing service telegram reported that  million brazilians had downloaded its app while the whatsapp ban was in place on march   diego dzodan facebooks vicepresident for latin america was arrested in brazil for not cooperating with an investigation in which whatsapp conversations were requested on march   at dawn the next day dzodan was released because the court of appeal held that the arrest was disproportionate and unreasonable on may   mobile providers in brazil were ordered to block whatsapp for  hours for the services second failure to cooperate with criminal court orders once again the block was lifted following an appeal after nearly  hours business model in response to the facebook acquisition in  slate columnist matthew yglesias questioned whether the companys business model of charging users  a year was viable in the united states in the long term it had prospered by exploiting a loophole in mobile phone carriers pricing mobile phone operators arent really selling consumers some voice service some data service and some sms service he explained they are selling access to the network the different pricing schemes they come up with are just different ways of trying to maximize the value they extract from consumers as part of that carriers sold sms separately that made it easy for whatsapp to find a way to replicate sms using data and then sell that to mobile customers for  a year but if whatsapp gets big enough then carrier strategy is going to change he predicted you stop selling separate sms plans and just have a takeitorleaveit overall package and then suddenly whatsapp isnt doing anything the situation may have been different in countries other than the united states on january   whatsapps founder jan koum announced that the service would no longer charge their users a  annual subscription fee in an effort to remove a barrier faced by some users who do not have a credit card to pay for the service he also explained that the app would not display any third party advertisement and instead would bring new features such as the ability to communicate with
