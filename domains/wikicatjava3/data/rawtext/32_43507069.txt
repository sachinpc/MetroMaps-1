blendweb blendweb is an open source framework for creating and displaying interactive d computer graphics in web browsers overview the blendweb framework leverages blender to edit d scenes content rendering relies on webgl web audio and other web standards without the use of plugins it is duallicensed and is distributed under an open source gplv and a commercial license the source code is hosted on github a d scene can be prepared in blender and then exported as a pair of json and binary files to load in a web application it can also be exported as a single selfcontained html file in which exported data the web player gui and the engine itself are packed the html option is considered to be the simplest way of using blendweb the resulting file which is reported to have a minimum size of  mb can be embedded in a web page using a standard iframe html element blendwebpowered web applications can be deployed on popular social networking websites such as facebook the blendweb toolchain consists of javascript libraries the blender addon and a set of tools for tweaking d scene parameters debugging and optimization blendweb development was started by a moscowbased company called triumph in  it was first publicly released on march   features the framework has a number of components typically found in game engines including positional audio system physics engine a fork of bullet ported to javascript animation system and an abstraction layer for game logic programming up to  different types of animations can be assigned to a single object including skeletal and pervertex animation the speed and the direction of animation forwardbackward play as well as particle system parameters size initial velocity and count can be changed though the api among other supported features are scene data dynamic loading and unloading subsurface scattering simulation and imagebased lighting some outofbox options exist for rendering extended outdoor environments including foliagewind interaction water atmosphere and sunlight simulation one example demonstrating these effects is the farm tech demo which also features multiple animated npcs and the ability to walk interact with objects and drive a vehicle in firstperson mode being based on the crossbrowser webgl api blendweb runs in the majority of web browsers including mobile ones there are some caveats for browsers with experimental webgl support though such as internet explorer there are also applications developed to run on tizenpowered devices such as samsung gear s smartwatch advanced features include draw call batching hidden surface determination threaded physics simulation and ocean simulation in version  blendweb introduced the possibility of adding interactivity to d scenes using a visual programming tool the tool is reminiscent of the bges logic editor as it uses logic blocks which are placed inside blender it plays back animation tracks authored by an artist when the user interacts with predefined d objects since version  blendweb has supported attaching html elements such as information windows to d objects annotations and copying objects in run time instancing among postprocessing effects the following features are supported glow bloom depth of field crepuscular rays motion blur and screen space ambient occlusion virtual reality devices have been supported since the end of  specifically oculus rift headmounted display works over experimental webvr api the software also now includes preliminary support for gamepads based on the gamepad api blender integration the blender addon is written in python and c and can be compiled for the linux xx os x x and ms windows xx platforms a blendwebspecific profile can be activated in the addon settings when switching to this profile the blender interface changes so that it only reveals settings relevant to blendweb blendweb supports a set of blenderspecific features such as the node material editor a tool for visual shader programming and the particle system there is basic support for blenders nonlinear animation nla editor for creating simple scenarios blendweb is essentially based on blenders realtime glsl rendering engine which users are recommended to use in order to enable wysiwyg editing comparison with relevant software blender game engine similar to the blender game engine bge blendweb directly loads and plays back scene data extracted from blender scenes without the use of an intermediate editor being a web framework it targets web browsers while a bge executable must be run offline it provides its own javascript api which is different from the pythonbased api of the bge a web development approach is proposed instead of a combination of logic blocks and python scripting used in the bge unity unity has offered a webgl build option since version  a survey by a unity game developer was conducted to compare these two engines two interactive webbased presentations of a turbofan were created using blendweb and unity although the author noted that both engines produced similar visual quality unitys webgl build had a total file size of  mb uncompressed while the blendwebs exported html file for the same scene was only  mb uncompressed according to their webgl roadmap unity has no plans to support mobile devices positional audio system and video textures in the near future threejs the popular webgl library threejs is reported to require programming for trivial tasks thus demanding more competence from users and offering a slow learning curve in blendweb most of the work in preparing online presentations can be done without any programming notable uses nasa developed an interactive web application called experience curiosity to celebrate the rd anniversary of the curiosity rover landing on mars this blendwebbased app makes it possible to operate the rover control its cameras and the robotic arm and reproduces some of the prominent events of the mars science laboratory mission the application was presented at the beginning of the webgl section at siggraph  dassault systmes presented an interactive card to greet its customers with the upcoming christmas holidays greenpeace created interactive d infographics to back greenpeaces detox campaign in russia tallink featured an interactive d presentation of its ms megastar vessel to allow the visitors to browse details of the ship
