java platform micro edition java platform micro edition or java me is a java platform designed for embedded systems such as mobile devices for example target devices range from industrial controls to mobile phones especially feature phones and settop boxes java me was formerly known as java  platform micro edition jme java me was designed by sun microsystems acquired by oracle corporation in  the platform replaced a similar technology personaljava originally developed under the java community process as jsr  the different flavors of java me have evolved in separate jsrs sun provides a reference implementation of the specification but has tended not to provide free binary implementations of its java me runtime environment for mobile devices rather relying on third parties to provide their own as of  december  the java me source code is licensed under the gnu general public license and is released under the project name phoneme as of  all java me platforms are currently restricted to jre  features and use that version of the class file format internally known as version  should oracle ever declare a new round of java me configuration versions that support the later class file formats and language features such as those corresponding to jre  or  notably generics it will entail extra work on the part of all platform vendors to update their jres java me devices implement a profile the most common of these are the mobile information device profile aimed at mobile devices such as cell phones and the personal profile aimed at consumer products and embedded devices like settop boxes and pdas profiles are subsets of configurations of which there are currently two the connected limited device configuration cldc and the connected device configuration cdc there are more than  billion java me enabled mobile phones and pdas it is popular in sub  devices such as nokias series  it was also used on the bada operating system and on symbian os along with native software users of windows ce windows mobile maemo meego and android can download java me for their respective environments connected limited device configuration the connected limited device configuration cldc contains a strict subset of the javaclass libraries and is the minimum amount needed for a java virtual machine to operate cldc is basically used for classifying myriad devices into a fixed configuration a configuration provides the most basic set of libraries and virtualmachine features that must be present in each implementation of a jme environment when coupled with one or more profiles the connected limited device configuration gives developers a solid java platform for creating applications for consumer and embedded devices the configuration is designed for devices with kb to kb total memory which has a minimum of kb of rom and kb of ram available for the java platform mobile information device profile designed for mobile phones the mobile information device profile includes a gui and a data storage api and midp  includes a basic d gaming api applications written for this profile are called midlets almost all new cell phones come with a midp implementation and it is now the de facto standard for downloadable cell phone games however many cellphones can run only those midlets that have been approved by the carrier especially in north america jsr  mobile information device profile  final release on  dec  specified the rd generation mobile information device profile midp expanding upon the functionality in all areas as well as improving interoperability across devices a key design goal of midp is backward compatibility with midp content information module profile the information module profile imp is a profile for embedded headless devices such as vending machines industrial embedded applications security systems and similar devices with either simple or no display and with some limited network connectivity originally introduced by siemens mobile and nokia as jsr imp  is a strict subset of midp  except that it doesnt include user interface apis  in other words it doesnt include support for the java package codice jsr also known as impng is imps next generation that is based on midp  leveraging midp s new security and networking types and apis and other apis such as codice and codice but again it doesnt include ui apis nor the game api connected device configuration the connected device configuration is a subset of java se containing almost all the libraries that are not gui related it is richer than cldc foundation profile the foundation profile is a java me connected device configuration cdc profile this profile is intended to be used by devices requiring a complete implementation of the java virtual machine up to and including the entire java platform standard edition api typical implementations will use some subset of that api set depending on the additional profiles supported this specification was developed under the java community process personal basis profile the personal basis profile extends the foundation profile to include lightweight gui support in the form of an awt subset this is the platform that bdj is built upon implementations sun provides a reference implementation of these configurations and profiles for midp and cdc starting with the javame  sdk a netbeansbased ide will support them in a single ide in contrast to the numerous binary implementations of the java platform built by sun for servers and workstations sun does not provide any binaries for the platforms of java me targets with the exception of an midp  jre jvm for palm os sun provides no jme jre for the microsoft windows mobile pocket pc based devices despite an openletter campaign to sun to release a rumored internal implementation of personaljava known by the code name captain america third party implementations like jblend and jbed are widely used by windows mobile vendors like htc and samsung operating systems targeting java me have been implemented by docomo in the form of doja and by savaje as savaje os the latter company was purchased by sun in april  and now forms the basis of suns javafx mobile the company ist provides a java me virtual machine microjvm for any rtos and even with no rtos then qualified as baremetal when baremetal the virtual machine is the osrtos the device boots in java microemu provides an open source lgpl implementation of an midp emulator this is a java appletbased emulator and can be embedded in web pages the opensource mika vm aims to implement javame cdcfp but is not certified as such certified implementations are required to charge royalties which is impractical for an opensource project consequently devices which use this implementation are not allowed to claim javame cdc compatibility the linuxbased android operating system uses a proprietary version of java that is similar but not identical to java me esr the esr consortium is devoted to standards for embedded java especially cost effective standards typical applications domains are industrial control machinetomachine medical emetering home automation consumer
