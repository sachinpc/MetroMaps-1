lame lame is an encoder that converts audio to the mp file format lame is a free software project that has had many improvements since it was first released in  including an improved psychoacoustic model lame is widely recommended as an mp encoder because it performs well in codec listening tests the lame encoder outperforms early encoders like lenc lame is required by some programs eg audacity to create mp files lame is required as an addon for many open source audio programs because the mp format is encumbered by software patents having these patented procedures which require licensing in some countries moved to a separate program allows open source programmers to avoid having to worry about those copyright issues history the name lame is a recursive acronym for lame aint an mp encoder around mid mike cheng created lame  as a set of modifications against the hzmp encoder source code after some quality concerns raised by others he decided to start again from scratch based on the dist mpeg reference software sources his goal was only to speed up the dist sources and leave its quality untouched that branch a patch against the reference sources became lame  the project quickly became a team project mike cheng eventually left leadership and started working on toolame an mp encoder mark taylor then started pursuing increased quality in addition to better speed and released version  featuring gpsycho a new psychoacoustic model he developed a few key improvements in chronological order patents and legal issues like all mp encoders lame implements some technology covered by patents owned by the fraunhofer society and other entities the developers of lame do not themselves license the technology described by these patents distributing compiled binaries of lame its libraries or programs that derive from lame in countries that recognize those patents may be patent infringing the lame developers state that since their code is only released in source code form it should only be considered as an educational description of an mp encoder and thus does not infringe any patent by itself when released as source code only at the same time they advise users to obtain a patent license for any relevant technologies that lame may implement before including a compiled version of the encoder in a product some software is released using this strategy companies use the lame library but obtain patent licenses in november  there were reports that the extended copy protection rootkit included on some sony compact discs included portions of the lame library without complying with the terms of the lgpl
