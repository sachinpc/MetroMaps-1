gradle gradle is an open source build automation system that builds upon the concepts of apache ant and apache maven and introduces a groovybased domainspecific language dsl instead of the xml form used by apache maven of declaring the project configuration gradle uses a directed acyclic graph dag to determine the order in which tasks can be run gradle was designed for multiproject builds which can grow to be quite large and supports incremental builds by intelligently determining which parts of the build tree are uptodate so that any task dependent upon those parts will not need to be reexecuted the initial plugins are primarily focused around java groovy and scala development and deployment but more languages and project workflows are on the roadmap example java project consider the case where the maven directory structure is used for java sources and resources these directories are srcmainjava srcmainresources srctestjava and srctestresources buildgradle apply plugin java running gradle build will result in  gradle build build successful the java plugin emulates many of the expected maven lifecycles as tasks in the directed acyclic graph of dependencies for the inputs and outputs of each task for this simple case the build task depends upon the outputs of the check and assemble tasks likewise check depends upon test and assemble depends upon jar for projects that do not follow the maven conventions gradle allows the directory structure to be configured the following example would support a project that contains source files in srcjava rather than the srcmainjava convention enforced by maven buildgradle apply plugin java sourcesetsmainjavasrcdirs  srcjava example ant migration gradle has a very tight integration with ant and even treats ant build files as scripts that could be directly imported while building the example below shows a simplistic ant target being incorporated as a gradle task buildxml buildgradle antimportbuild buildxml running gradle anttarget will result in  gradle anttarget antecho running anttarget build successful
