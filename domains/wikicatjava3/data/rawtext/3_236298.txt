limbo programming language limbo is a programming language for writing distributed systems and is the language used to write applications for the inferno operating system it was designed at bell labs by sean dorward phil winterbottom and rob pike the limbo compiler generates architectureindependent object code which is then interpreted by the dis virtual machine or compiled just before runtime to improve performance therefore all limbo applications are completely portable across all inferno platforms limbos approach to concurrency was inspired by hoares communicating sequential processes csp as implemented and amended in pikes earlier newsqueak language and winterbottoms alef language features limbo supports the following features virtual machine the dis virtual machine that executes limbo code is a cisclike vm with instructions for arithmetic control flow data motion process creation synchronizing and communicating between processes loading modules of code and support for higherlevel datatypes strings arrays lists and communication channels it uses a hybrid of reference counting and a realtime garbagecollector for cyclic data examples limbo uses adastyle definitions as in books the rd edition of the inferno operating system and limbo programming language are described in the textbook inferno programming with limbo isbn  chichester john wiley  sons  by phillip stanleymarbell another textbook the inferno programming book an introduction to programming for the inferno distributed system by martin atkins charles forsyth rob pike and howard trickey was started but never released
