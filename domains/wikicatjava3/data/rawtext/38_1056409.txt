oracle grid engine oracle grid engine previously known as sun grid engine sge codine computing in distributed networked environments or grd global resource director was a grid computing computer cluster software system otherwise known as batchqueuing system acquired as part of a purchase of terraspring then improved and supported by sun microsystems and later oracle there have been open source versions and multiple commercial versions of this technology initially from sun later from oracle and then from univa corporation this technology forked from the same codebase as hps udc and ibms eliza in  on october   univa announced it acquired the intellectual property and trademarks for the grid engine technology and that univa will take over support the original grid engine opensource project website closed in  but versions of the technology are still available under its original sun industry standards source license those projects were forked from the original project code and are known as son of grid engine and open grid scheduler grid engine is typically used on a computer farm or highperformance computing hpc cluster and is responsible for accepting scheduling dispatching and managing the remote and distributed execution of large numbers of standalone parallel or interactive user jobs it also manages and schedules the allocation of distributed resources such as processors memory disk space and software licenses grid engine used to be the foundation of the sun grid utility computing system made available over the internet in the united states in  later becoming available in many other countries and having been an early version of a public cloud computing facility predating amazon aws for instance features the below feature sets date from the last sun releases in  or earlier more current feature information can be found on the web sites of the open source forks or for univa grid engine features in  other features of sge include platforms grid engine runs on multiple platforms including cluster architecture a typical grid engine cluster consists of a master host and one or more execution hosts multiple shadow masters can also be configured as hot spares which take over the role of the master when the original master host crashes support and training univa is providing commercial support and training for univa grid engine and oracle grid engine below is a description of some of the historic options sun provided support contracts for the commercial version of grid engine on most unix platforms and windows professional services consulting training and support were provided by sun partners sun partners with georgetown university to deliver grid engine administration classes the bioteam runs short sge training workshops that are  or  days long users obtained community support on the grid engine mailing lists grid engine workshops were held in     and  in regensburg germany users again the below contains historic information more recent deplyoment information specifically regarding commercial users is available from univa notable deployments of sge include history in  sun acquired gridware inc a privately owned commercial vendor of advanced computing resource management software with offices in san jose calif and regensburg germany later that year sun offered a free version of gridware for solaris and linux and renamed the product sun grid engine in  sun made the source code available and adopted the open source development model ports for mac os x and bsd were contributed by the nonsun open source developers in  after the purchase of sun by oracle the grid engine  update  source code was not included with the binaries and changes were not put back to the projects source repository in response to this the grid engine community started the open grid scheduler project to continue to develop and maintain a free implementation of grid engine on january   it was announced that univa had recruited several principal engineers from the former sun grid engine team and that univa would be developing their own forked version of grid engine the newly announced univa grid engine did include commercial support and would compete with the official version of oracle grid engine on oct   univa has announced that it had acquired the intellectual property and trademarks pertaining to the grid engine technology and that univa will take over support for oracle grid engine customers addon software a number of sge addons are available
