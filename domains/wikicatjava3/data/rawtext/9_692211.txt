cms pipelines cms pipelines implements the pipeline concept under the vmcms operating system the programs in a pipeline operate on a sequential stream of records a program writes records that are read by the next program in the pipeline any program can be combined with any other because reading and writing is done through a device independent interface overview cms pipelines provides a cms command pipe the argument string to the pipe command is the pipeline specification pipe selects programs to run and chains them together in a pipeline to pump data through because cms programs and utilities dont provide a device independent stdin and stdout interface cms pipelines has a builtin library of programs that can be called in a pipeline specification these builtin programs interface to the operating system and perform many utility functions cms pipelines users issue pipeline commands from the terminal or in exec procedures users can write programs in rexx that can be used in addition to the builtin programs example a simple example that reads a disk file separates records containing the string hello from those that do not and writes both sets of records to different disk files can be written as where the codice stage reads the input disk file the two codice stages write the output disk files and the codice stage separates the input stream into two output streams codices primary output records containing hello is passed to the first codice stage and its secondary output records not containing hello is passed through the codice connector to the second codice stage the  divides the specification into  pipelines the collection of pipelines is called a pipeline set features the concept of a simple pipeline is extended in these ways cms pipelines offers several features to improve the robustness of pipelines history john hartmann of ibm denmark started development of cms pipelines in  the product was marketed by ibm as a separate product during the s and integrated in vmesa late  with each release of vm the cms pipelines code was upgraded as well until it was functionally frozen at the  level in vmesa  in  since then the latest level of cms pipelines has been available for download from the cms pipelines homepage for users who wish to explore new function an implementation of cms pipelines for tso was released in  as batchpipeworks in the batchpipesmvs product the uptodate tso implementation has been available as a service offering from ibm denmark until  both versions are maintained from a single source code base and commonly referred to as cmstso pipelines the specification is available in the authors edition
