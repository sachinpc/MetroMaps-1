java tv java tv is a javabased software framework designed for use on tv settop boxes based on components called xlets it is currently used only on the connected device configuration specifically for itv applications development the api includes the xlet classes in the package javaxtvxlet other packages of the public api include criticisms while the framework is general sun currently provides support only on java me for some subjects such as media locators it is in effect superseded by other locator standards on platforms such as bdj a point of confusion is that in platforms supported as of  examples such as the svcdispxlet example from the introduction to the api written circa  are not deployable because it uses awt widgets such as javaawtbutton most itv platforms along with bdj implement personal basis profile with no awt widgets as opposed to personal profile which includes the widgets suns reference implementation for java tv attempts to limit its exposure to support issues to the full java media framework by having its own small version of jmf that is internally referred to as jmflite as with the limitations of the midp emulators that sun provides the java tv reference implementation provided by sun has not been updated to make provisions for later jdks such as removing calls to threadstop the threadstop method was made a final method in java  meaning that classes which extend thread and override stop will fail at runtime under jre  when the class is loaded this implies that sun has not yet committed to public plans or a roadmap for taking java me beyond jre  if such an upgrade were to take place it would require significant work on the part of all vendors of java meenabled devices
