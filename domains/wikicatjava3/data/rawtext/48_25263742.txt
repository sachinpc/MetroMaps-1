cubrid cubrid  cuberid is an open source sqlbased relational database management system rdbms with object extensions developed by naver corporation for web applications the name cubrid is a combination of the two words cube and bridge cube standing for a sealed box that provides security for its contents while bridge standing for data bridge license policy cubrid has a separate license for its server engine and its interfaces the server engine adopts the gpl v or later license which allows distribution modification and acquisition of the source code cubrid apis and gui tools have the berkeley software distribution license in which there is no obligation of opening derivative works the reason of adopting two separate license systems is to provide complete freedom to independent software vendors isv to develop and distribute cubridbased applications architecture the feature that distinguishes cubrid database from other relational database systems is its tier clientserver architecture which consists of the database server the connection broker and the application layer database server the database server is the component of the cubrid database management system which is responsible for storage operations and statement execution a cubrid database server instance can mount and use a single database making interdatabase queries impossible however more than one instance can run on a machine unlike other solutions the database server does not compile queries itself but executes queries precompiled in a custom access specification language connection broker the cubrid connection brokers main roles are also a local object pool enables some parts of the execution to be deferred from the database server eg tuple insertion and deletion ddl statements thus lowering the database server load since the connection broker is not bound to the same machine as the database server cubrid can take advantage of the hardware resources of several machines while processing queries on a single database application layer applications can use one of the available apis to connect to a cubrid connection broker features high availability cubrid high availability provides loadbalanced faulttolerant and continuous service availability through its sharednothing clustering failover and failback automated mechanisms cubrids tier architecture allows native support for highavailability with twolevel auto failover the broker failover and server failover broker failover when connecting to a broker via a client api users can specify in the connection url a list of alternative hosts where brokers are listening for incoming requests in case of a hardware network operating system or software failure on one of the hosts the underlying client api automatically fails over to the next host that a user has provided server failover the high availability environment can be built with n masterslave server nodes each slave node communicates with the master via cubrid heartbeat protocol when a master node is unresponsive the first of the slave nodes will get promoted to a master role replication between nodes can be achieved in one of three modes synchronous semisynchronous and asynchronous administrators can specify a list of server hosts each broker can connect to and in the event of a failure of the master node another will be used scalability and maintainability database sharding cubrid provides builtin support for database sharding the sharding interface is implemented by a special broker called cubrid shard communicating with cubrid shard is identical to communicating with a normal broker so the same client apis can be used all features of the normal broker such as failover and load balancing also apply to cubrid shard the storage is implemented as separate independent physical databases located on separate cubrid server hosts each shard can be fully configured into high availability environment the data distribution logic among shards lies in cubrid shard which determines which shard to use for storage or retrieval of data based on a hash or user defined algorithm backup cubrid supports online offline and incremental backup performance apilevel load balancing because a connection broker can be configured in four different modes readwrite readonly slaveonly preferred host read only the list of alternative hosts which a user has provided via the connection url can be used as a method to balance the load when load balancing is used the client api will randomly choose a host among those specified in the connection url except the one which was used to connect to last time if the chosen host is not available the selection will continue until all the hosts are determined as unavailable in such case the driver will report an error query plan caching a query execution plan cache is implemented on the broker in order to skip most of the compilation steps on often used queries because the queries are parametrized during parsing two queries that differ only by the values of literal constants share the same cache entry storage indexes cubrid has support for btree indexes both singlecolumn and multicolumn the following types of indexes can be created the query optimizer can use indexes to produce faster execution plans using methods such as table partitioning cubrid supports horizontal partitioning by range hash and value lists with a maximum of  partitions per table partitions can be accessed independently and support most operations that are valid on a normal table as of version  cubrid implements executiontime partition pruning sql support cubrid implements a large subset of the ansi standard extended with features from later sql standards and custom features window functions cubrid provides support for window functions as defined in the standard the implemented functions are rownumber count min max sum avg stddevpop stddevsamp varpop varsamp rank denserank lead lag and ntile hierarchical queries hierarchical queries using the nonstandard start with  connect by oracle syntax are supported in cubrid a number of specialized pseudocolumns and operators are provided for controlling the behavior of the query execution built in clickcounter cubrid optimizes the common scenario in web applications where database fields need to be incremented on certain events eg page views in contrast to the usual approach of using a selectupdate statement combination cubrid can increment fields from within the select statement execution bypassing some expensive compiling execution and locking overhead associated with an update statement java stored procedures the only stored procedure language supported in cubrid is java requiring a java virtual machine to be installed on the system the virtual machine is started and managed by the server and is used for code execution stored procedure code that requires database access must use the jdbc driver either using the parent transaction or issuing a new one regular expression in addition to the like operator cubrid provides the regexp operator for regular expression pattern matching by default the operator does a case insensitive matching on the input string but the modifier binary can be used for case sensitive scenarios an optional alias of regexp is rlike currently cubrid does not support regexp on unicode strings data types a variety of data types are supported by cubrid supported platforms cubrid is available for microsoft windows and linux most distributions for  and bit architectures partial support for os x is implemented interfaces command line cubrid comes with a builtin commandline interface named csql that can be used to execute sql statements on the cubrid server the tool can be used in one of two modes cubrids csql also implements some internal commands related to schema information plan generation debugging transaction control query timing and more programming cubrid provides a number of languagespecific application programming interfaces c driver also called cci cubrids native driver jdbc phppdo driver odbc oledb adonet ruby driver python driver nodejs driver and perl driver graphical several graphical user interface tools have been developed for cubrid applications some applications and websites that have added cubrid support or are powered by cubrid
