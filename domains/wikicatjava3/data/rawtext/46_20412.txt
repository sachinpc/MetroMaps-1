matlab matlab matrix laboratory is a multiparadigm numerical computing environment and fourthgeneration programming language a proprietary programming language developed by mathworks matlab allows matrix manipulations plotting of functions and data implementation of algorithms creation of user interfaces and interfacing with programs written in other languages including c c c java fortran and python although matlab is intended primarily for numerical computing an optional toolbox uses the mupad symbolic engine allowing access to symbolic computing abilities an additional package simulink adds graphical multidomain simulation and modelbased design for dynamic and embedded systems in  matlab had around one million users across industry and academia matlab users come from various backgrounds of engineering science and economics history cleve moler the chairman of the computer science department at the university of new mexico started developing matlab in the late s he designed it to give his students access to linpack and eispack without them having to learn fortran it soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the applied mathematics community jack little an engineer was exposed to it during a visit moler made to stanford university in  recognizing its commercial potential he joined with moler and steve bangert they rewrote matlab in c and founded mathworks in  to continue its development these rewritten libraries were known as jackpac in  matlab was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation lapack matlab was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in control engineering littles specialty but quickly spread to many other domains it is now also used in education in particular the teaching of linear algebra numerical analysis and is popular amongst scientists involved in image processing syntax the matlab application is built around the matlab scripting language common usage of the matlab application involves using the command window as an interactive mathematical shell or executing text files containing matlab code variables variables are defined using the assignment operator codice matlab is a weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted it is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects and that their type can change values can come from constants from computation involving values of other variables or from the output of a function for example vectors and matrices a simple array is defined using the colon syntax initcodiceincrementcodiceterminator for instance defines a variable named codice or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name codice which is an array consisting of the values     and  that is the array starts at  the init value increments with each step from the previous value by  the increment value and stops once it reaches or to avoid exceeding  the terminator value the increment value can actually be left out of this syntax along with one of the colons to use a default value of  assigns to the variable named codice an array with the values     and  since the default value of  is used as the incrementer indexing is onebased which is the usual convention for matrices in mathematics although not for some programming languages such as c c and java matrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to terminate each row the list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets  parentheses  are used to access elements and subarrays they are also used to denote a function argument list sets of indices can be specified by expressions such as  which evaluates to    for example a submatrix taken from rows  through  and columns  through  can be written as a square identity matrix of size n can be generated using the function eye and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions zeros and ones respectively most matlab functions can accept matrices and will apply themselves to each element for example codice will multiply every element in j by  and then reduce each element modulo n matlab does include standard for and while loops but as in other similar applications such as r using the vectorized notation often produces code that is faster to execute this code excerpted from the function magicm creates a magic square m for odd values of n matlab function codice is used here to generate square matrices i and j containing n structures matlab has structure data types since all variables in matlab are arrays a more adequate name is structure array where each element of the array has the same field names in addition matlab supports dynamic field names field lookups by name field manipulations etc unfortunately matlab jit does not support matlab structures therefore just a simple bundling of various variables into a structure will come at a cost functions when creating a matlab function the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file valid function names begin with an alphabetic character and can contain letters numbers or underscores functions are also often case sensitive function handles matlab supports elements of lambda calculus by introducing function handles or function references which are implemented either in m files or anonymousnested functions classes and objectoriented programming matlab supports objectoriented programming including classes inheritance virtual dispatch packages passbyvalue semantics and passbyreference semantics however the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages matlab has value classes and reference classes depending on whether the class has handle as a superclass for reference classes or not for value classes method call behavior is different between value and reference classes for example a call to a method can alter any member of object only if object is an instance of a reference class an example of a simple class is provided below when put into a file named hellom this can be executed with the following commands graphics and graphical user interface programming matlab supports developing applications with graphical user interface gui features matlab includes guide gui development environment for graphically designing guis it also has tightly integrated graphplotting features for example the function plot can be used to produce a graph from two vectors x and y the code produces the following figure of the sine function a matlab program can produce threedimensional graphics using the functions surf plot or mesh in matlab graphical user interfaces can be programmed with the gui design environment guide tool interfacing with other languages matlab can call functions and subroutines written in the programming languages c or fortran a wrapper function is created allowing matlab data types to be passed and returned the dynamically loadable object files created by compiling such functions are termed mexfiles for matlab executable since  increasing twoway interfacing with python is being added libraries written in perl java activex or net can be directly called from matlab and many matlab libraries for example xml or sql support are implemented as wrappers around java or activex libraries calling matlab from java is more complicated but can be done with a matlab toolbox which is sold separately by mathworks or using an undocumented mechanism called jmi javatomatlab interface which should not be confused with the unrelated java metadata interface that is also called jmi official matlab api for java was added in  as alternatives to the mupad based symbolic math toolbox available from mathworks matlab can be connected to maple or mathematica libraries also exist to import and export mathml license matlab is a proprietary product of mathworks so users are subject to vendor lockin although matlab builder products can deploy matlab functions as library files which can be used with net or java application building environment future development will still be tied to the matlab language each toolbox is purchased separately if an evaluation license is requested the mathworks sales department requires detailed information about the project for which matlab is to be evaluated if granted which it often is the evaluation license is valid for two to four weeks a student version of matlab is available as is a homeuse license for matlab simulink and a subset of mathworks toolboxes at substantially reduced prices it has been reported that european union eu competition regulators are investigating whether mathworks refused to sell licenses to a competitor the regulators dropped the investigation after the complainant withdrew their accusation and no evidence of wrongdoing was found alternatives matlab has a number of competitors commercial competitors include mathematica tk solver maple and idl there are also free open source alternatives to matlab in particular gnu octave scilab freemat julia and sagemath which are intended to be mostly compatible with the matlab language among other languages that treat arrays as basic entities array programming languages are apl fortran  and higher slang as well as the statistical languages r and s there are also libraries to add similar functionality to existing languages such as it for c perl data language for perl ilnumerics for net numpyscipymatplotlib for python sciluatorch for lua sciruby for ruby and numericjs for javascript gnu octave is unique from other alternatives because it treats incompatibility with matlab as a bug see matlab compatibility of gnu octave therefore gnu octave attempts to provide a software clone of matlab release history the number or release number is the version reported by concurrent license manager program flexlm for a complete list of changes of both matlab and official toolboxes consult the matlab release notes easter eggs several easter eggs exist in matlab these include hidden pictures and jokes for example typing in spy will generate a picture of the spies from spy vs spy spy was changed to an image of a dog in recent releases rb typing in why randomly outputs a philosophical answer other commands include penny toilet image and life not every easter egg appears in every version of matlab
