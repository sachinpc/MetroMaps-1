kotlin programming language kotlin is a staticallytyped programming language that runs on the java virtual machine and also can be compiled to javascript source code its primary development is from a team of jetbrains programmers based in saint petersburg russia the name comes from the kotlin island near st petersburg kotlin was named language of the month in the january  issue of dr dobbs journal while not syntax compatible with java kotlin is designed to interoperate with java code and is reliant on java code from the existing java class library such as the collections framework history in july  jetbrains unveiled project kotlin a new language for the jvm which had been under development for a year jetbrains lead dmitry jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for with the exception of scala however he cited the slow compile time of scala as an obvious deficiency one of the stated goals of kotlin is to compile as quickly as java in february  jetbrains open sourced the project under the apache  license jetbrains hopes that the new language will drive intellij idea sales kotlin v was released on february   this is considered to be the first officially stable release and jetbrains has committed to longterm backwards compatibility starting with this version philosophy development lead andrey breslav has said that kotlin is designed to be an industrialstrength objectoriented language and to be a better language than java but still be fully interoperable with java code allowing companies to make a gradual migration from java to kotlin syntax like pascal typescript haxe plsql f go and scalaand unlike c and its derivatives such as c java c and dkotlin variable declarations and parameter lists have the data type come after the variable name and with a colon separator as in other modern languages such as scala and groovy semicolons are optional as a statement terminator in most cases a newline is sufficient for the compiler to deduce that the statement has ended semantics in addition to the classes and methods called member functions in kotlin of objectoriented programming kotlin also supports procedural programming with the use of functions as in c and c the entry point to a kotlin program is a function named main which is passed an array containing any command line arguments perl and unixlinux shell scriptstyle string interpolation is supported type inference is also supported hello world example fun mainargs  array  kotlin makes a distinction between nullable and nonnullable datatypes all nullable objects must be declared with a  postfix after the type name operations on nullable objects need special care from developers nullcheck must be performed before using the value kotlin provides nullsafe operators to help developers fun sayhellomaybe  string nevernull  int  an example of the use of the safe navigation operator applications one of the obvious applications of kotlin is android development the platform has been long stuck on java  note retrolambda and the transition to jack compiler and kotlin introduces many improvements for programmers such as nullpointer safety extension functions and infix notation accompanied by  java compatibility and good ide support android studio it gives an excellent way to improve code readability extend android sdk classes and speed up development users according to the kotlin website prezi is using kotlin in the backend dripstat has done a writeup of their experience with kotlin other languages other languages targeting the jvm
