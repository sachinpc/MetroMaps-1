gecko software gecko is a web browser engine used in many applications developed by mozilla foundation and the mozilla corporation notably the firefox web browser including its mobile version other than ios devices and their email client thunderbird as well as in many other open source software projects gecko is free and opensource software subject to the terms of the mozilla public license version  it is designed to support open internet standards and is used by different applications to display web pages and in some cases an applications user interface itself by rendering xul gecko offers a rich programming api that makes it suitable for a wide variety of roles in internetenabled applications such as web browsers content presentation and clientserver gecko is written in c and is crossplatform and runs on various operating systems including bsds linux os x solaris os aix openvms and microsoft windows its development is now overseen by the mozilla foundation history development of the layout engine now known as gecko began at netscape in  following the companys purchase of digitalstyle the existing netscape rendering engine originally written for netscape navigator  and upgraded through the years was slow did not comply well with wc standards had limited support for dynamic html and lacked features such as incremental reflow when the layout engine rearranges elements on the screen as new data is downloaded and added to the page the new layout engine was developed in parallel with the old with the intention being to integrate it into netscape communicator when it was mature and stable at least one more major revision of netscape was expected to be released with the old layout engine before the switch after the launch of the mozilla project in early  the new layout engine code was released under an opensource license originally unveiled as raptor the name had to be changed to nglayout next generation layout due to trademark problems netscape later rebranded nglayout as gecko while mozilla organization the forerunner of the mozilla foundation initially continued to use the nglayout name gecko was a netscape trademark eventually the gecko branding won out in october  netscape announced that its next browser would use gecko which was still called nglayout at the time rather than the old layout engine requiring large parts of the application to be rewritten while this decision was popular with web standards advocates it was largely unpopular with netscape developers who were unhappy with the six months given for the rewrite it also meant that most of the work done for netscape communicator  including development on the mariner improvements to the old layout engine had to be abandoned netscape  the first netscape release to incorporate gecko was released in november  the name netscape  was never used as gecko development continued other applications and embedders began to make use of it america online by this time netscapes parent company eventually adopted it for use in compuserve  and aol for mac os x these products had previously embedded internet explorer however with the exception of a few betas gecko was never used in the main microsoft windows aol client on july   aol laid off the remaining gecko developers and the mozilla foundation formed on the same day became the main steward of gecko development today gecko is developed by employees of the mozilla corporation employees of companies that contribute to the mozilla project and volunteers standards support from the outset gecko was designed to support open internet standards some of the standards gecko supports include gecko also partially supports svg  in order to support web pages designed for legacy versions of netscape and internet explorer gecko supports doctype switching documents with a modern doctype are rendered in standards compliance mode which follows the wc standards strictly documents that have no doctype or an older doctype are rendered in quirks mode which emulates some of the nonstandard oddities of netscape communicator x however some of the x features such as layers are not supported gecko also has limited support for some nonstandard internet explorer features such as the marquee element and the codice property though pages explicitly testing for codice will be told it is not supported usage gecko is primarily used in web browsers the earliest being netscape  and mozilla suite later renamed seamonkey it is also used in other mozilla web browser derivatives such as firefox and firefox for mobile and the implementation of the internet explorerclone that is part of wine mozilla also uses it in their thunderbird emailclient and their firefox os other web browsers using gecko include airfox waterfox kmeleon lunascape pale moon portable firefox conkeror classilla tenfourfox hp secure web browser oxygen and sylera for mobile other products using gecko include conkeror oxygen nightingale instantbird and googles pictureorganization software picasa for linux devhelp a gtkgnome browser for api documentation used gecko for rendering documents gecko is also used by sugar for the olpc xo computer gecko is used as a complete implementation of the xul xml user interface language gecko currently defines the xul specification products that have historically used gecko include songbird epiphany now known as web and no longer using gecko sunbird calendar and other web browsers including swiftfox flock galeon camino minimo beonex communicator kazehakase and microb after gecko  the version number was bumped to  to match firefox  and from then on has been kept in sync with the major version number for both firefox and thunderbird to reflect the fact that it is no longer a separate component criticism in the past gecko had slower market share adoption due to the complexity of the gecko code which aimed to provide much more than just an html renderer for web browsers mozillas engineering efforts since then have addressed many of these historical weaknesses the gecko engine also provides a versatile xmlbased user interface rendering framework called xul that was used extensively in mail newsgroup and other programs another reason for much of the complexity in gecko is the use of xpcom a crossplatform component model however its use has been scaled back on windows and similar platforms gecko depends on nonfree compilers thus foss distributions of linux can not include the gecko package used in the windows compatibility layer wine
