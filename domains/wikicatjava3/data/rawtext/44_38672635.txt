glfw glfw is a lightweight utility library for use with opengl it provides programmers with the ability to create and manage windows and opengl contexts as well as handle joystick keyboard and mouse input software architecture glfw is a small c library that allows the creation and management of windows with opengl contexts making it also possible to use multiple monitors and video modes it provides access to input from keyboard mouse and joysticks the api provides a thin multiplatform abstraction layer primarily for applications whose sole graphics output is through the opengl api while glfw is very useful when developing multiplatform opengl applications singleplatform developers can also benefit from avoiding having to deal with kludgy platformspecific apis a possible reason that libraries like glfw are needed is that opengl by itself does not provide any mechanisms for creating the necessary context managing windows user input timing etc there are several other libraries available for aiding opengl development the most common ones are freeglut an open source implementation of glut and sdl however freeglut is mostly concerned with providing a stable clone of glut while sdl is too large for some people and has never had opengl as its main focus glfw is predicated on the assumption that there is room for a lightweight modern library for managing opengl contexts windows and input glfw is by design not programming language bindings although glfw is written in c bindings do exist to use the api with other programming languages including ada c common lisp d go haskell java python rebol red ruby and rust among others backends glfw version  has experimental support for mir and wayland through compiletime flags
