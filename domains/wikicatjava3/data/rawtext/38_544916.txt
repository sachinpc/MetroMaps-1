project looking glass project looking glass is a now inactive free software project under the gpl to create an innovative d desktop environment for linux solaris and windows it was sponsored by sun microsystems looking glass is programmed in the java language using the java d system to remain platform independent despite the use of graphics acceleration features the desktop explores the use of d windowing capabilities for both existing application programs and ones specifically designed for looking glass there is a live cd available from project looking glass the looking glass environment is also included on a live dvd funworks  edition from the granular linux project history looking glass was first developed by hideya kawahara a sun programmer who wrote it in his spare time on a small linux laptop after demonstrating an early version to sun executives he was assigned to it fulltime with a dedicated team and open sourced the project it was first demonstrated publicly by jonathan schwartz at linuxworld expo  in san francisco and since then has gathered momentum in development after unveiling the prototype steve jobs called schwartzs office and told him that apple would sue sun if sun moved forward to commercialize it jobs claimed that the project is infringing apples ip regardless of the threat sun determined that the project was not of priority and decided not to put more resource to develop it further into product quality the project thus had been continuing in an experimental mode however as suns financial situation became tighter and the management determined they had higher priority projects on their hand the project became inactive practically dead since late  features one of its most notable features is the creation of reversible windows this capability can be used for features like allowing the user to write notes and comments on the windows backs or displaying application dialogs without risking their being detached from the application they relate to all windows start by looking like a normal d or d window but can be manipulated as thin slatelike d objects which can be set at any angle or turned completely around by the user other features include tilting all the window to assist the user to pick up a desired window provision of a panning virtual desktop icons that reflect the live status of the window they represent and zooming of a window when it receives focus there are a few designs that looking glass implemented which appeared in other products in later years one technique became popular by apples dashboard widgets is configuration of an application widget by flipping its visual and performing updates on the backside of it the visual of apples mac os x dock became similar to looking glasss look when leopard was released microsoft windows  implements a feature for window selection that hides other windows than the one that the user placed the mouse cursor on a thumbnail above the taskbar it resembles looking glasss usage of transparency for window selection using window thumbnails on the taskbar similar projects looking glass is similar to the taskgallery prototype from microsoft research and the open source croquet project based on squeak in terms of allowance for the user to manipulate applications including existing d applications in a d space however user interaction models of taskgallery and croquet are based on virtual realitylike experience where the user moves inside the d space to perform tasks whereas looking glass retains the operational model of todays desktop ie no walking around inside the d space and uses d effects selectively where they are thought to be effective also these three are similar as they are meant to work on adapted or enhanced versions of existing desktops rather than redesigning the entire graphical user interface from scratch an approach taken by many zooming user interface projects such as the one created by jef raskin while many window managers such as microsofts desktop window manager the x window system based compiz and mac os x through core animation can utilize d effects these merely augment a conventional d environment
