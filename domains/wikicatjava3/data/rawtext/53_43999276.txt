activejpa activejpa is an opensource application framework written in java for objectrelational mapping it is based on the java persistence api jpa but it does not strictly follow the jsr  specification as it implements different design patterns and technologies motivation the framework originated as an effort to add behavior to entities making them act as active records it also implements a different way for proxying persistence operations transaction management intercepting operations validating logging and caching using crosscutting concerns to decouple these responsibilities to retain modularity encapsulating them into aspects features and technologies convention over configuration coding by convention is the best way to decrease the number of decisions made by developers while implementing a technology activejpa does not require any initial configuration other than a datasource or connection details to the database to have an up and running persistence context it supports specific and unconventional aspects of the application as well by using annotations dsl type safe querying by using type safe domainspecific language dsl all database queries can be made by using a fluent objectoriented interface aspects persistence operations transaction management interception validation logging and caching are vertically defined by using crosscutting concerns and encapsulating all these responsibilities into aspects it improves performance scatters and tangles code design and implementation database access the database access is abstracted from the jdbc  specification supporting java  and new jdbc features transaction management activejpa handles jta nested transactions global transactions and transactions managed on a jdbc connection
