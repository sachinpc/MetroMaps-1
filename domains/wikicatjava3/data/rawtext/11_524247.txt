lasso programming language lasso is an application server and server management interface used to develop internet applications and is a generalpurpose highlevel programming language originally a web datasource connection tool for filemaker and later included in apple computers filemaker  and claris homepage as cdml it has since evolved into a complex language used to develop and serve largescale internet applications and web pages lasso includes a simple template system allowing code to control generation of html and other content types lasso is objectoriented and every value is an object it also supports procedural programming through unbound methods the language uses traits and multiple dispatch extensively lasso has a dynamic type system where objects can be loaded and augmented at runtime automatic memory management a comprehensive standard library and three compiling methodologies dynamic comparable to phppython justintime compilation comparable to java or net framework and precompiled comparable to c lasso also supports query expressions allowing elements within arrays and other types of sequences to be iterated filtered and manipulated using a natural language syntax similar to sql lasso includes full unicode character support in the standard string object allowing it to serve and support multibyte characters such as japanese and swedish and supports transparent utf conversion when writing string data to the network or file system lasso is often used as a scripting language and also used in a wide range of nonscripting contexts lasso code can be packaged into standalone executable programs called lassoapps in which folder structures are compiled into single files the lasso server application server runs as a system service and receives requests from the web server through fastcgi it then hands the request off to the appropriate lasso instance which formulates the response multiple individual instances are supported allowing one server to handle multiple sites each as separate processes the server uses a high performance iobased green threading system designed for multicore systems lasso can be compared to the serverside scripting languages php and python coldfusion ruby etc free for development lasso allows partial access to its source code allowing developers to add or change major components of the language for example ke carltons ds implementation of the lasso inline licensing comes in both sas and standalone versions history lasso began in the mids when early web developers were attempting to connect apples filemaker pro database with the world wide web on the mac platform there were two solutions eric bickfords webfm and russell owens filemaker cgi rofm both built in applescript and requiring the use of filemaker pro calculation fields for formatting webfm was subsequently rewritten in c in the fall of  developer vince bonafonti wrote a new cgi based on rofm using cc for improved performance and using the notion of htmlbased templates instead of relying on calculation fields this proved very popular in the filemaker community and was brought to the attention of bill doerrfeld owner of blue world communications inc a print and website development firm based out of issaquah washington who bought the source code at this time blue world experimented with improvements for the cgi in the frontier scripting environment which inspired the name lasso further need for improvement drove the creation of a cbased cgi which was later released as lasso  at this point lasso only worked with filemaker pro x and webstar and only ran on apple mac os  and above lassos popularity grew most notably from reviews in print publications and blue worlds hosting of and participation in many email discussion lists many of which specifically pertained to filemaker pro blue world also made frequent appearances and was known as a leading company at macworld conferences following the release of the lasso  lineup in january  blue world and the bonfantis entered private talks with claris the software division of apple computer and owner of filemaker pro claris eventually licensed the postversion lasso source code and with the help of vince and paul bonfanti released the filemaker web companion as a component of filemaker pro  filemaker web companions language cdml claris dynamic markup language differed from lasso s ldml lasso dynamic markup language but was close enough as to offer an easy transition for developers looking to serve from filemaker pro through thirdparty servers and offered more compelling features including the lassolike web companion in filemaker  helped grow popularity for lasso in the fastgrowing macintosh web development community blue world continued developing lasso with kyle jessup becoming lassos lead programmer lasso  was released in july  introducing some fundamental shifts in how lasso could be used on february   blue world released lasso  a radical departure from the filemakercentric language to date there was never a lasso  release the version number skipped from  to  lasso  included among many updates a completely rewritten architecture for os x windows linux and an embedded mysql database though lasso  still spoke to a filemaker database but not to a filemaker server filemaker as a data source remained relatively slow compared to an sql engine and was prohibitively more expensive since v lasso was fully multithreaded allowing many connections at once but succumbed to filemakers latency or lag in certain operations and there was no way to get around it reliably other than to make major changes to the data source lasso  also added support for apache http server natively under os x windows and linux joining webstar  appleshare ip which was replaced by os x server and itools from tenon mac os  on which lasso had been used for many years was unsupported this drove closer ties to a classic lamp server architecture blue world communications released a series of plugins for popular web development packages from macromedia and adobe lasso studio  for dreamweaver was a runner up in macworld magazines editors choice awards for internet and development in  losing out to adobe dreamweaver  lasso studio for dreamweaver  was also reviewed favorably by macworld magazine earning  and a half mice later version of lasso studio supported both macromedia dreamweaver and adobe golive including lasso studio  for dreamweaver and golive on march   with the release of filemaker server and filemaker server advanced version  in  filemaker signaled a major change in their strategy for serving data to web sites they emphasized xmlxslt odbc and jdbc connectivity but only through the more expensive filemaker server advanced product blue world began to distance the lasso language from filemaker and apple in  lasso pro received mysql network certification demonstrating the importance of the popular open source database to the future of lasso on august  of  bill doerrfeld officially sold the lasso product line to omnipilot software inc in ft lauderdale florida lasso  was the last version of lasso released by blue world on october   omnipilot officially announced the release of lasso  a version including sandboxing for multiple sites on the same server and connectivity to many new datasources this also included the first free version of lasso limited to ip addresses omnipilot followed this release with a number of complementary products including lasso studio  for dreamweaver and golive on march   lasso studio for eclipse chartfx integration and a number of free lassobased solutions in  three omnipilot employees kyle jessup the original developer of lasso  fletcher sandbeck an early employee of blue world known for regular tips and tricks and kerry adams an employee of omnipilot created a new company lassosoft llc to purchase the intellectual property of lasso from omnipilot and continue development recognizing the need to be competitive against much more popular languages such as php and asp radical changes in architecture syntax and structure were made and released as lasso  technical challenges caused by these changes coupled with limited marketing resources led to significant community decline as the company struggled to release documentation and support for the new language in december  a new canadian company was formed lassosoft inc which bought and invested heavily in the lasso  language marketing and documentation kyle jessup agreed to stay on as both lassos lead developer and benevolent dictator for life several releases  and  have released further developments in recent years code examples hello world here are three ways to say hello world on a lasso page square brackets are reserved in lasso so html entities must be used to show square brackets on lasso pages for other purposes than marking lasso tags alternatively printing square brackets can be by lasso or be disabled by including nosquarebrackets at the file top inlines inlines are the basic lasso tool for database actions database commands can be issued as above in lassos dbindependent metalanguage in which case the same search code works for mysql filemaker pro or for any other database backend with which lasso can connect if needed a sql statement can of course be embedded in the inline when using a database server that supports sql in the above example the dashes  before commands denote optional parameters these can be specified in any order and generated dynamically the last of any duplicate parameters take precedence the inline command supports a large range of parameters allowing developers to interact with databases that they may not have intimate knowledge of custom database connectors can be created which allows leveraging the abstracted nature of the inline command  bottles of beer the next procedural example prints out the lyrics for the song  bottles of beer the next example uses an oop approach to print out the lyrics when the object is represented as a string
