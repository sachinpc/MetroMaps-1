drupal drupal  a free and opensource contentmanagement framework written in php and distributed under the gnu general public license provides a backend framework for at least  of all web sites worldwide  ranging from personal blogs to corporate political and government sites systems also use drupal for knowledge management and for business collaboration the standard release of drupal known as drupal core contains basic features common to contentmanagement systems these include user account registration and maintenance menu management rss feeds taxonomy page layout customization and system administration the drupal core installation can serve as a simple web site a single or multiuser blog an internet forum or a community web site providing for usergenerated content the drupal overview a feature of the project web site describes it as a content management framework drupal also describes itself as a web application framework as it meets the generally accepted feature requirements for such frameworks although drupal offers a sophisticated api for developers basic website installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills drupal runs on any computing platform that supports both a web server capable of running php and a database to store content and configuration history originally written by dries buytaert as a message board drupal became an open source project in  the name drupal represents an english rendering of the dutch word druppel which means drop as in a water droplet the name came from the nowdefunct droporg web site whose code slowly evolved into drupal buytaert wanted to call the site dorp dutch for village for its community aspects but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better interest in drupal got a significant boost in  when it helped build deanspace for howard dean one of the candidates in the us democratic partys primary campaign for the  us presidential election deanspace used opensource sharing of drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately  disparate unofficial prodean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign after dean ended his campaign members of his web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a web platform that could aid political activism by launching civicspace labs in july  the first company with fulltime employees that was developing and distributing drupal technology other companies began to also specialize in drupal development by  the drupal web site listed hundreds of vendors that offered drupalrelated services on march   buytaert announced a code freeze for drupal  for september   drupal  was released on january   with release parties in several countries after that maintenance on drupal  stopped with only drupal  and drupal  maintained drupal  series maintenance updates are released regularly on december   drupal  started its feature completion about three years later on october   drupal  first release candidate rc was announced drupal  includes new features and improvements for both users and developers including a revamped user interface wysiwyg and inplace editing improved mobile support added and improved key contributed modules including views date and entity reference introduced a new objectoriented backend leveraging symfony components revamped configuration management and improved multilingual support drupal  rc is the collective work of over  core contributors on january   a drupal fork called backdrop was released drupal  was released on november   a subsequent upgrade to it is also available in the form of drupal  that brings numerous improvements including ckeditor wysiwyg enhancements added apis an improved help page and two new experimental modules experimental modules are meant for testing purposes but are not yet fully supported core in the drupal community the term core refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and for versions prior to drupal  is kept outside of the sites folder of a drupal installation starting with version  core is kept in its own core subdirectory drupal core is the stock element of drupal bootstrap and common libraries are defined as drupal core and all other functionalites are defined as drupal modules including the system module itself in a drupal websites default configuration content can be contributed by either registered or anonymous users at the discretion of the administrator and is made accessible to web visitors by a variety of selectable criteria as of drupal  drupal has adopted some symfony libraries into drupal core core modules also includes a hierarchical taxonomy system which allows content to be categorized or tagged with key words for easier access drupal maintains a detailed changelog of core feature updates by version core modules drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website the core drupal distribution provides a number of features including core themes drupal includes core themes which customize the look and feel of drupal sites for example garland and bartik the color module introduced in drupal core  allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface localization  drupal had been made available in  languages and english the default support is included for righttoleft languages such as arabic persian and hebrew drupal localization is built on top of gettext the gnu internationalization and localization in library autoupdate notification drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules themes or the drupal core its important to update quickly after security updates are released before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core modules theme files and database if there is any error shown after update or new updates is not compatible with a module then it can be quickly replace by backup there are several backup modules available in drupal on october   a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released two weeks later the drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within  hours of the announcement are infected thus it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like drush is highly recommended database abstraction prior to version  drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases such as sql query cleansing multisite table name prefixing and generating proper sql queries in particular drupal  introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create sql queries without writing sql drupal  extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write sql queries as text strings it uses php data objects to abstract the database microsoft has written a database driver for their sql server drupal  supports the filebased sqlite database engine which is part of the standard php distribution embracing windows developers with drupal s new database abstraction layer and ability to run on the windows web server iis it is now easier for windows developers to participate in the drupal community a group on drupalorg is dedicated to windows issues accessibility with the release of drupal  web accessibility has been greatly improved by the drupal community drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities because many of the best practices have been incorporated into the program code core the accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community drupal  started the adoption of waiaria support for rich internet applications and this has been carried further in drupal  there have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of drupal especially the community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in drupal  extending the core drupal core is modular defining a system of hooks and callbacks which are accessed internally via an api this design allows thirdparty contributed modules and themes to extend or override drupals default behaviors without changing drupal cores code drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes this increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their sites customizations the drupal community has the saying never hack core a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files modules contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries custom content types and content listings wysiwyg editors private messaging thirdparty integration tools integrating with enterprise applications and more the drupal website lists more than  free modules some of the most commonly used contributed modules include themes  there are more than  free communitycontributed themes themes adapt or replace a drupal sites default look and feel drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common thirdparty theme design engines many are written in the phptemplate engine or to a lesser extent the xtemplate engine some templates use hardcoded php drupal  will integrate the twig templating engine the inclusion of the phptemplate and xtemplate engines in drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity the drupal theming system utilizes a template engine to further separate htmlcss from php a popular drupal contributed module called devel provides gui information to developers and themers about the page build communitycontributed themes at the drupal website are released under a free gpl license and most of them are demonstrated at the drupal theme garden distributions in the past those wanting a fully customized installation of drupal had to download a pretailored version separately from the official drupal core today however a distribution defines a packaged version of drupal that upon installation provides a website or application built for a specific purpose the distributions offer the benefit of a new drupal site without having to manually seek out and install thirdparty contributed modules or adjust configuration settings they are collections of modules themes and associated configuration settings that prepare drupal for custom operation for example a distribution could configure drupal as a brochureware site rather than a news site or an online store architecture drupal is based on the presentation abstraction control architecture or pac the menu system acts as the controller it accepts input via a single source http get and post routes requests to the appropriate helper functions pulls data out of the abstraction nodes and from drupal  onwards forms and then pushes it through a filter to get a presentation of it the theme system it even has multiple parallel pac agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas pagetplphp community drupalorg has a large community of users and developers who provide active community support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of drupal as of march  over  user accounts and over  developer accounts the semiannual drupalcon conference alternates between north america europe and asia attendance at drupalcon grew from  at szeged in august  to over  people at austin texas in june  smaller events known as drupal camps or drupalcamp occur throughout the year all over the world the annual florida drupalcamp brings users together for coding for a cause that benefits a local nonprofit organization as does the annual gladcamp greater los angeles drupal camp event coders with a cause the drupal community also organizes professional and semiprofessional gatherings called meetups at a large number of venues around the world in july  droplabs a coworking space in los angeles california was recognized as the worlds top drupal location with  recorded events when compared with other event venues over a month period there are a number of active drupal forums mailing lists and discussion groups drupal also maintains several irc channels on the freenode network there are over  national communities around drupalorg offering languagespecific support security drupals policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released administrators of drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the update status module drupal  or via the update manager drupal  drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list a history of all security advisories a security team home page and an rss feed with the most recent security advisories in  eleven security vulnerabilities were reported and fixed in the drupal core security holes were also found and fixed in  of the  usercontributed modules in midoctober  drupal issued a highly critical security advisory regarding an sql injection bug in drupal  also known as drupalgeddon downloading and installing an upgrade to drupal  fixes the vulnerability but does not remove any backdoor installed by hackers if the site has already been compromised attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced according to the drupal security team where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static html page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised to solve the problem the site must be restored using backups from before october  be patched and manually updated and anything merged from the site must be audited criticism in an article about the adoption of drupal by the whitehousegov site slate associate editor chris wilson lists some common criticisms of drupal other criticisms have included as of  there were  modules posted on drupalorg  are sandbox modules which are described as experimental code for developer use only  modules are considered full projects of these full projects   are under active development this is the best scenario   are maintenance fixes only where the maintainer is no longer interested in developing new features but has committed to address any security vulnerability which might be discovered these modules should also be considered safe to use   are marked no further development while   are considered obsolete often because this functionality has been better addressed through another module   full project modules have not had their development status set the drupal web site includes a page with instructions for developers on taking over maintenance of unmaintained projects
