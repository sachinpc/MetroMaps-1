adobe air adobe air formerly adobe integrated runtime is a crossplatform runtime system developed by adobe systems for building desktop applications and mobile applications programmed using adobe flash actionscript and optionally apache flex the runtime supports installable applications on windows os x and mobile operating systems like android ios and blackberry tablet os it also originally run on linux but support was discontinued as of version  in  adobe air is a runtime environment that allows adobe flash content and actionscript  code to construct applications and video games that run outside a web browser and behave as a native application on supported platforms an application developed for flash player or html and deployed in a browser does not require installation while air applications require installation from an installer file windows and os x or the appropriate app store ios and android air applications have unrestricted access to local storage and file systems while browserbased applications only have access to individual files selected by users adobe air internally uses the flash player rendering engine and actionscript  as the primary programming language flash applications must specifically be built for adobe air to use additional features provided such as multitouch file system integration native client extensions integration with taskbar or dock and access to accelerometer and gps devices html applications may run on the webkit engine included in air notable applications built with adobe air include ebay desktop pandora one desktop tweetdeck the former adobe media player angry birds and machinarium among other multimedia and task management applications according to adobe over  unique applications were built on air and over  billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world as of may  adobe air was voted as the best mobile application development product at the consumer electronics show for two consecutive years ces  and ces  features using air developers can access the full adobe flash functionality including text vector graphics raster graphics video audio camera and microphone capability adobe air also includes additional features such as file system integration native client extensions desktop integration and access to connected devices air enables applications to work with data in different ways including using local files local sqlite databases for which air has builtin support a database server or the encrypted local store included with air developers can access additional functionality by building air native extensions which can access full device functionality being programmed in the native language desktop features on desktop platforms air supports mobile features on mobile platforms air supports many mobile hardware features d graphics in  the addition of staged to the flash player allowed flash and air apps access to gpus for hardware acceleration several thirdparty frameworks have been developed to build upon the functionality of staged including the starling framework and awayd these frameworks are also compatible with air and provide vital performance improvements to air apps published for mobile devices air native extensions air apps can be augmented in functionality with the usage of air native extensions anes native extensions are plugin code libraries that contain native code wrapped with an actionscript api allowing developers to access native features not otherwise usable in air such as apple game center or google cloud messaging native extensions may be developed by anyone using publicly available tools some are distributed for free or even as open source while others are sold commercially native extensions may be programmed in the native language on each platform allowing access to the full set of platform apis provided by the developer c for windows java for android objectivec for ios availability air is a crossplatform technology and air applications can be repackaged with few or no changes for many popular desktop and mobile platforms different installation options exist for each platform air applications may be published with or without the air runtime applications packaged with the air runtime are larger in file size and are known as captive runtime applications if the runtime is not embedded in the app it must be installed separately in january  adobe claimed that there were over  million installations of adobe air worldwide and that the majority of air runtime installations occur at the time the first air application is installed by a user in may  adobe claimed that over  unique applications were built on air and over  billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world desktop platforms the latest version of adobe air version  contains adobe flash player  and is available for windows xp and later as well as os x official support for desktop linux distributions ceased in june  with version  mobile platforms adobe air applications can be published as native phone applications on certain mobile operating systems such as android arm cortexa and above and apple ios the following table explains to what extent adobe air can run on various mobile operating systems application development adobe air runs flash applications within a contained flash player instance it runs web applications via webkit rendering engine multiple instances of the browser can be started within a single air application but javascript content executes with some security limitations air does not provide direct access to native gui elements such as navigation bars or controls native extensions can be used to access additional native resources development tools sdks the air sdk is available as a free standalone download for software developers to make air applications sdk users do not need to install any commercial software to use the sdk although several options are available air apps can be compiled from the command line using the air compiler included in the sdk the compiler can also be called from an ide to eliminate the need for the command line air can also be used with adobe flex flex is an integrated collection of stylable graphical user interface data manipulation and networking components and applications built upon it are known as flex applications flex guis are defined in mxml similar to how android and microsoft visual studio define guis however flex does not give access to native gui components air applications built without the flex framework allow greater flexibility and performance and are known as pure actionscript applications video games built on the air platform are typically pureactionscript projects various opensource component frameworks are available for pure actionscript projects such as madcomponents that provide ui components at significantly smaller swf file sizes software adobe distributes three commercial software products for developing of air applications in actionscript thirdparty development environments that target the air runtime are also available including adobe flash builder is the premium tool for flex application development since it includes an integrated draganddrop user interface builder not found in competing tools like flashdevelop javascript applications adobe provides for air html and javascript development with adobe dreamweaver cs although any other html editor or text editor can be used adobe air can run a subset of javascript with no ability to dynamically execute code when running in the application sandbox according to adobe this restriction is designed to prevent malicious remote content from attacking a users system because of this restriction javascript frameworks that make use of dynamic javascript functions like eval were not initially compatible with adobe air however several frameworks including dojo toolkit jquery and extjs were updated to run in adobe airs application sandbox some frameworks like mootools were already compatible dreamweaver cscs requires an additional extension to compile air applications as does flash cs in the form of an update release history apollo  betas adobe made a public preview release of air then called apollo along with a software development kit sdk and extension for developing apollo applications with the flex framework on march   on june   apollo was renamed to air and a public beta release of the runtime was launched public beta  of air sdk was released on october   public beta
