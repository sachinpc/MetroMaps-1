openjdk openjdk open java development kit is a free and open source implementation of the java platform standard edition java se it is the result of an effort sun microsystems began in  the implementation is licensed under the gnu general public license gnu gpl version  with a linking exception were it not for the gpl linking exception components that linked to the java class library would be subject to the terms of the gpl license openjdk is the official reference implementation of java se since version  components the openjdk project produces a number of components most importantly the virtual machine hotspot the java class library and the java compiler javac the webbrowser plugin and web start which form part of oracle java are not included in openjdk sun previously indicated that they would try to opensource these components but neither sun nor oracle have done so the only currently available free plugin and web start implementations are those provided by icedtea in september  an oracle employee detailed plans to add aot compilation to the openjdk using the graal compiler supported jdk versions openjdk was initially based only on the jdk  version of the java platform there are several separate openjdk projects icedtea and inclusion in software distributions in order to bundle openjdk in fedora and other free gnulinux distributions openjdk needed to be buildable using only free software components due to the encumbered components in the class library and implicit assumptions within the build system that the jdk being used to build openjdk was a sun jdk this was not possible to achieve openness red hat started the icedtea project in june  it began life as an openjdkgnu classpath hybrid that could be used to bootstrap openjdk replacing the encumbrances with code from gnu classpath on november   red hat signed both the sun contributor agreement and the openjdk community tck license one of the first benefits of this agreement is tighter alignment with the icedtea project which brings together fedora the linux distribution and jboss the application server technologies in a linux environment icedtea provided free software alternatives for the few remaining proprietary sections in the openjdk project in may  the fedora  and ubuntu  distributions included icedtea  based completely on free and open source code fedora  was the first version to be shipped with icedtea based on the openjdk sources from sun rather than openjdk it was also the first to use openjdk for the package name via the openjdk trademark agreement instead of icedtea ubuntu also first packaged icedtea before later moving to icedtea packages for icedtea were also created for debian and included in lenny on july   debian accepted openjdk in unstable and it is now in stable openjdk is also available on opensuse red hat enterprise linux and rhel derivatives such as centos in june  red hat announced that the packaged binaries for openjdk on fedora  built using icedtea  had passed the technology compatibility kit tests and could claim to be a fully compatible java  implementation in july  an icedtea  binary build for ubuntu  passed all of the compatibility tests in the java se  tck since august  openjdk  is usable on mac os x and other bsd variants on android nougat openjdk replaces the nowdiscontinued apache harmony as the java libraries in the source code of the mobile operating system google has been in an ongoing legal dispute with oracle over claims of copyright and patent infringement through its use of reimplementations of copyrighted java apis via harmony while also stating that this change was to create a more consistent platform between java on android and other platforms the company admitted that the switch was motivated by the lawsuit arguing that oracle had authorized its use of the openjdk code by licensing it under the gpl history suns promise and initial release sun announced in javaone  that java would become opensource software and on october   at the oracle openworld conference jonathan schwartz said that the company intended to announce the opensourcing of the core java platform within  to  days sun released the java hotspot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the gnu general public license on november   with a promise that the rest of the jdk which includes the java runtime environment would be placed under the gpl by march  except for a few components that sun does not have the right to publish in source form under the gpl according to freesoftware advocate richard stallman this would end the java trap the vendor lockin that he argues applied to java and programs written in java release of the class library following their promise to release a java development kit jdk based almost completely on free and open source code in the first half of  sun released the complete source code of the java class library under the gpl on may   except for some limited parts that had been licensed to sun by third parties and sun was unable to relicense under the gpl included in the list of encumbered parts were several major components of the java graphical user interface gui sun stated that it planned to replace the remaining proprietary components with alternative implementations and to make the class library completely free when initially released in may   of the openjdk class library remained proprietary by the appearance of openjdk  in may  less than  the snmp implementation which is not part of the java specification remained making it possible to build openjdk without any binary plugs the binary plug requirement was later dropped from openjdk  as part of b in april  this was made possible over the course of the first year by the work of sun microsystems and the openjdk community each encumbrance was either released as free and open source software or replaced with an alternative beginning in december  all the socalled binary plugs were replaced by open source replacements making the whole jdk open sourced and the binary plugs not necessary anymore community improvements on november   red hat announced an agreement with sun signing suns broad contributor agreement which covers participation in all sunled free and open source software projects by all red hat engineers and suns openjdk community technology compatibility kit tck license agreement which gives the company access to the test suite that determines whether a project based on openjdk complies with the java se  specification also on november  the porters group was created on openjdk to aid in efforts to port openjdk to different processor architectures and operating systems the bsd porting project is led by kurt miller and greg lewis and the mac os x porting project based on the bsd one led by landon fuller have expressed interest in joining openjdk via the porters group and as of january  are part of the mailing list discussions another project pending formalization on the porters group is the haiku java team led by bryan varner on december  sun moved the revision control of openjdk from teamware to mercurial as part of the process of releasing it to open source communities openjdk has comparatively strict procedures of accepting code contributions every proposed contribution must be reviewed by another openjdk committer and the contributor must have signed the sunoracle contributor agreementscaoca preferably there should also be a jtreg test demonstrating that the bug has been fixed initially the external patch submission process was slow and commits to the codebase were only made by sun engineers until september  the process has improved and  simple patches and backports from openjdk  to openjdk  can take place within hours rather than days on  september  microsoft and azul systems collaborated to create zulu a build of openjdk for users of the windows azure cloud zulu is available as a free download from the community site at zuluorg you can also get zulu on amazon web services via canonicals juju charm store the docker hub and azul systems repositories collaboration with ibm apple and sap on october   ibm by far the biggest participant in the apache harmony project decided to join oracle on the openjdk project effectively shifting its efforts from harmony to openjdk bob sutor ibms head of linux and open source blogged that ibm will be shifting its development effort from the apache project harmony to openjdk on november   apple inc just three weeks after deprecating its own java runtime port and oracle corporation announced the openjdk project for mac os x apple will contribute most of the key components tools and technology required for a java se  implementation on mac os x including a bit and bit hotspotbased java virtual machine class libraries a networking stack and the foundation for a new graphical client on january   the mac os x port project was created on openjdk and apple made the first public contribution of code to the project the initial apple contribution built on the openjdk bsd port in july  sap ag announced that sap officially joined the openjdk project
