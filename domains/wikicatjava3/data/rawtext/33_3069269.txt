opera mini opera mini is a web browser designed primarily for mobile phones smartphones and personal digital assistants until version  it used the java me platform requiring the mobile device to run java me applications from version  it is also available as a native application for android bada ios symbian os and windows mobile opera mini is offered free of charge supported mainly through deals with mobile operators to have opera mini preinstalled in phones and other sources of revenue such as search advertising deals licensing and paid bookmarks and speed dial placement opera mini was derived from the opera web browser for personal computers which has been publicly available since  opera mini began as a pilot project in  after limited releases in europe it was officially launched worldwide on  january  opera mini requests web pages through opera softwares servers which process and compress them before sending them to the mobile phone speeding up transfer by two to three times and dramatically reducing the amount of data transferred chargeable on many mobile phone data plans the preprocessing increases compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones however interactive sites which depend upon the device processing javascript do not work properly in july  it was reported that opera mini had  million users  in february  opera reported  million unique opera mini active users and  billion page views served during that month this represented an increase of  million users from september  history origin opera mini was derived from the opera web browser for personal computers which has been publicly available since  opera mini was originally intended for use on mobile phones not capable of running a conventional web browser it was introduced on  august  as a pilot project in cooperation with the norwegian television station tv  and only available to tv  customers a beta version was made available in sweden denmark norway and finland on  october  after the final version was launched in germany on  november  and quietly released to all countries through the opera mini website in december the browser was officially launched worldwide on  january  on  may  opera mini  was released it included new features such as the ability to download files new custom skins more search engine options on the builtin search bar a speed dial option new search engines and improved navigation on  november  opera mini  beta introduced secure browsing rss feeds photo uploading and content folding into its list of features and capabilities content folding works by folding long lists such as navigation bars into a single line that can be expanded as needed a second beta was released on  november and on  november the final version of opera mini  was released opera mini  on  november  opera mini  was released according to johan schn technical lead of opera mini development the entire code was rewritten opera mini  includes the ability to view web pages similarly to a desktop based browser by introducing overview and zoom functions and a landscape view setting in overview mode the user can scroll a zoomedout version of certain web pages using a builtin pointer the user can zoom into a portion of the page to provide a clearer view this is similar to the functionality of operas nintendobased web browsers this version also includes the ability to synchronise with opera on a personal computer prior to opera mini  the browser was offered in two editions opera mini advanced for highmemory midp  phones and opera mini basic for lowmemory midp  phones opera mini  replaced opera mini advanced the older opera mini  basic was still available for lowmemory phones  originally google was the default search engine on opera mini on  january  opera software and yahoo announced a partnership to make yahoo search the default instead on  february  opera software announced that google would henceforth be the default search engine for opera mini and opera mobile a version for the android operating system was announced on  april  rather than port the code to android a wrapper was created to translate java me api calls to android api calls opera mini  on  august  opera software released opera mini  beta which included tabbed browsing a password manager improved touch screen support and a new interface with a visual speed dial similar to the one introduced by opera software in their desktop browser the browsers use of compression and encrypted proxybased technology to reduce traffic and speed page display has the side effect of allowing it to circumvent several approaches to internet censorship since  november  there have been reports from chinese users that when they use opera mini they are redirected to an error page leading them to download opera mini china version this is almost certainly due to the chinese government being concerned that users are using opera mini to bypass the great firewall in china opera agreed to route all of their traffic through government servers  a press release announcing that indonesias smart telecom had chosen opera mini for their devices said that opera mini was the worlds most popular mobile browser and that russia and indonesia were the largest users an iphone version was approved for distribution by the apple app store on  april  most opera mini versions use only the mini serverbased compression method with maximal compression but some issues with interactive applications nonmini versions of opera for phones and computers originally operated in uncompressed mode from v a selectable serverbased turbo mode called offroad in some versions was added similar to mini mode but bypassing compression for interactive functionality at the expense of less extreme data compression opera mini  for iphone released in  can operate in mini turbo and uncompressed modes effectively combining the functionality of the mobile and mini versions turbo and mini modes reduce the amount of data transferred which reduces cost on some phone contracts and increases speed on the slower connections typical of mobile phone networks with a highspeed connection uncompressed mode without delays due to diverting through the opera server compressing by the server and expansion by the device may work faster on  september  opera started taking registrations for the beta version of opera mini for windows phone opera mini was released for windows phone six days later on  september  as a public beta this marked operas return to microsofts mobile platform since the demise of windows mobile functionality the functionality of opera mini mode is somewhat different from that of a conventional web browser with the amount of data which has to be transferred much reduced but with some loss to functionality most versions of opera mini only work in this mode however the opera mini  program for ios but not the blackberryjme version was completely redesigned and can switch between mini turbo and uncompressed modes gaining functionality at the cost of lower compression in nonmini modes unlike straightforward web browsers opera mini fetches all content through a proxy server and reformats web pages into a format more suitable for small screens a page is compressed then delivered to the phone in a markup language called obml opera binary markup language which opera mini can interpret the data compression makes transfer time about two to three times faster and the preprocessing improves the display of web pages not designed for small screens by default opera mini opens one connection to the proxy servers which it keeps open and reuses as required this improves transfer speed and enables the servers to quickly synchronize changes to bookmarks stored in opera link the opera software company maintains over  proxy servers to handle opera mini traffic they run linux and are massively parallel and massively redundant smallscreen rendering for devices with screens  pixels wide or smaller the default rendering mode is smallscreen rendering ssr in this mode the page is reformatted into a single vertical column so that it need only be scrolled vertically long lists and navigation bars are automatically collapsed hiding most of the list or bar by a feature known as content folding a plus  sign is displayed next to the collapsed content when clicked it toggles content folding web developers can turn on ssr on the desktop edition of opera to see how their websites will be displayed on mobile editions of opera in ssr mode images are scaled down to no more than  of the screen size in either direction complex script rendering opera mini can send content in bitmap image form if a font required is not available on the device which is useful for indic scripts hindi and a few other nonlatin character sets are supported javascript support when browsing the web in opera mini mode javascript is processed by the proxy server and is merely rendered on the device this limits interactivity scripts cannot be run in the background on the device if a script is paused on the server the browser must communicate with the server to unpause it javascript will only run for a couple of seconds on the mini server before pausing due to resource constraints according to the documentation for opera mini  before the page is sent to the mobile device its codice events are fired and all scripts are allowed a maximum of two seconds to execute the codice and codice functions are disabled so scripts designed to wait a certain amount of time before executing will not execute at all after the scripts have finished or the timeout is reached all scripts are stopped and the page is compressed and sent to the mobile device once on the device only a handful of events are allowed to trigger scripts when one of these events is triggered sends a request to the proxy server to process the event the proxy server then executes the javascript and returns the revised page to the mobile device popups if not blocked by the javascript restrictions replace the web page being viewed opera has published web content authoring guidelines to assist authors opera mini  for ios can run in turbo and uncompressed modes in addition to mini mode in turbo mode the amount of data transferred is still much reduced by compression but unlike mini mode javascript is not intercepted by the server and works properly features scrolling is carried out by using the devices arrow keys its number keys or a stylus the display may be toggled between portrait and landscape mode by keystrokes or will switch automatically on phones with orientation sensors the default orientation can be changed the image quality may be set to low medium or high page load times are affected by the chosen image quality setting opera mini supports only one font which can be set to small medium large or extra large size if a web page uses courier or a generic monospaced font the one font is still used but the characters are spaced out so that each character takes up the same amount of space browsing tools opera mini has a search bar capable of using several preconfigured search engines the user can add more search engines the default search engines are google and wikipedia opera mini supports shortcut keys skins and a web feed aggregator it can save bookmarks download files save web pages for offline reading and it remembers the users browsing history since the launch of opera mobile store in march  speed dial of opera mini displays a shortcut to operas own mobile applications store privacy and security opera mini since  advanced encrypts the connection between the mobile device and the proxy server for privacy and security the encryption key is obtained on the first start by requesting that the user press random keys a certain number of times opera mini  basic does not support encryption opera mini has been criticised because it does not offer true endtoend security when visiting encrypted sites such as paypalcom when visiting an encrypted web page the opera software companys servers decrypt the page then reencrypt it themselves breaking endtoend security this reduces security and is relevant to applications such as internet banking standards support as of version  opera mini uses the same layout engine that is included in opera  consequently opera mini supports most of the web standards supported in opera  however unlike the desktop edition of opera opera mini includes no support for web forms  also frames are flattened because of client limitations and dotted and dashed borders are displayed as solid borders due to bandwidth and memory issues as opera mini reformats web pages it does not pass the acid standards compliance test opera mini supports bidirectional text meaning that it can correctly display righttoleft scripts such as arabic and hebrew in addition to languages written lefttoright however it will not display righttoleft text if the font size is set to small or very small indic and chinese scripts are supported only if an appropriate font is installed on the device as the default system font opera mini does not display text in italic or other formatting besides boldface lowmemory device support for midp  lowmemory devices the older opera mini  basic is still available its features include an option to increase the text size as the default text size is too small for some web sites opera mini  basic uses less advanced compression does not support full page view does not include support for favicons does not scroll as smoothly does not feature a builtin clock and does not support encryption when browsing an encrypted web page with opera mini  basic the page is decrypted before being sent to the mobile phone opera link bookmarks speed dials and search engines could be backedup to my opera until it closed on  march  and kept synchronized between different phones or with the opera browser on computers using the opera link service data centers opera mini relies on data centers processing the web page before sending it back to the phone in a compressed binary form market adoption the overall share of the opera family in the mobile web browser market was about  in october  figures for opera mini within this were not available most of users come from indonesia russia china and brazil it is also the most popular browser in several countries in africa network operators several mobile network companies preinstall opera mini on their mobile phones including telenor att vodafone tmobile kddi omnitel pannon gsm telefnica mviles de espaa and tmn devices the following devices came preinstalled with opera mini  some listed devices only included
