squeak the squeak programming language is a dialect of smalltalk it is objectoriented classbased and reflective it was derived directly from smalltalk by a group at apple computer that included some of the original smalltalk developers its development was continued by the same group at walt disney imagineering where it was intended for use in internal disney projects later on the group moved on to be supported by hp labs sap labs and most recently ycombinator squeak is crossplatform programs produced on one platform run bitidentical on all other platforms and versions are available for many platforms including the obvious windowsmacoslinux versions the squeak system includes code for generating a new version of the virtual machine vm on which it runs it also includes a vm simulator written in squeak for these reasons it is easily ported developers dan ingalls an important contributor to the squeak project wrote the paper upon which squeak is built and constructed the architecture for five generations of the smalltalk language squeak incorporates many of the elements alan kay proposed in the dynabook concept which he formulated in the s kay is an important contributor to the squeak project user interface frameworks squeak includes four user interface frameworks uses many squeak contributors collaborate on open cobalt a free and open source virtual world browser and construction toolkit application which is built on squeak squeak is also used in the nintendo es operating system and for implementing the scratch programming language for beginning programmers in may  the openqwaq virtual conferencing and collaboration system based on squeak an open source release of teleplace was announced on the teleplace blog license squeak  and later may be downloaded at no cost including source code as a prebuilt virtual machine image licensed under the mit license with the exception of some of the original apple code which is governed by the apache license originally apple actually released squeak under a license called the squeak license while source code was available and modification permitted the squeak license contained an indemnity clause that prevented it from qualifying as true free and opensource software in  apple relicensed squeak twice first in may apple used its own apple public source license which satisfies the free software foundations concept of a free software license and has attained official approval from the open source initiative as an open source license the apple public source license as it turns out fails to pass the third standard that free and open source software licenses are held to the debian free software guidelines promulgated by the debian project an influential volunteerrun linux distribution to enable inclusion of etoys in the one laptop per child project a second relicensing was undertaken using the apache license at this point an effort was also made to address the issue of code contributed by members of the squeak community which it was not in apples power to unilaterally relicense for each contribution made under the squeak license since  a relicensing statement was obtained authorizing distribution under the mit license and finally in march  the end result was released as squeak  now under combined mit and apache licenses squeak virtual machine the squeak virtual machine is a family of virtual machines vms used in smalltalk programming language implementations they are an essential part of any smalltalk implementation all are opensource software the current vm is a high performance dynamic translation system the relevant code is maintained on github at opensmalltalk
