icedtea icedtea is a build and integration project for openjdk launched by red hat in june  icedteaweb is a free software implementation of java web start and the java web browser plugin icedteasound is a collection of plugins for the java sound subsystem including the pulseaudio provider which used to be included with icedtea the free software foundation recommends that all java programmers use icedtea as their development environment historically the initial goal of the icedtea project was to make the openjdk software which sun microsystems released as free software in  usable without requiring any proprietary software and hence make it possible to add openjdk to fedora and other linux distributions that insist on free software this goal was met and a version of icedtea based on openjdk was packaged with fedora  in november  april  saw the first release of a new variant icedtea which is based on suns build drops of openjdk a fork of the openjdk with the goal of being compatible with the existing jdk this was released in ubuntu and fedora in may  the icedtea package in these distributions has been renamed to openjdk using the openjdk trademark notice in june  the fedora build passed suns rigorous tck testing on x and x icedtea  the first version based on openjdk  was released in october  icedtea  the first version based on openjdk  was released in april  history this project was created following suns release under open source licenses of its hotspot virtual machine and java compiler in november  and most of the source code of the class library in may  however parts of the class library such as font rendering colour management and sound support were only provided as proprietary binary plugins this was because the source code for these plugins was copyrighted to third parties rather than sun microsystems the released parts were published under the terms of the gnu general public license a free software license due to these missing components it was not possible to build openjdk only with free software components sun aimed to negotiate with the license holders to allow this code to be released under a free software license or failing that to replace these proprietary elements with alternative implementations with the plugins replaced the class library would then be completely free sun has continued to use the proprietary code in their certified binary releases following the announcement the icedtea project was started and was formally announced on june   with a build repository provided by the gnu classpath team the team could not call their software product openjdk because this is a trademark which was owned by sun microsystems they instead decided to use the temporary name icedtea on november   red hat signed both the sun contributor agreement and the openjdk community tck license the press release suggested that this would benefit the icedtea project simon phipps suggested the possibility of icedtea being hosted on openjdkjavanet and mark reinhold noted that signing the copyright assignment could allow red hat to contribute parts of icedtea to sun for inclusion in the mainstream jdk since then a number of patches from icedtea have made their way into openjdk on june  it was announced that icedtea as the packaged version of openjdk on fedora  has passed the technology compatibility kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible java  implementation the project continues to track openjdk  openjdk  and openjdk  development in separate repositories and contribute patches back upstream where possible the current state of each icedtea patch is maintained on the icedtea wiki aims the icedtea project started with two aims other benefits icedtea also provides a more familiar build system by providing a wrapper around the openjdk makefiles using the gnu autotools this removes the need to remember numerous environment variables for configuring the build the current icedtea builds set roughly forty such variables for the underlying openjdk build it has also provided a place for early work on features which will eventually appear in the main openjdk builds such as gervill and for work on ports to other platforms icedteaweb icedtea provides a freesoftware java web browser plugin it was the first to work in bit browsers under bit linux a feature suns proprietary jre later addressed this makes it suitable to enable support for java applets in bit mozilla firefox among others icedtea also provides a free java network launching protocol implementation sun has promised to release their plugin and web start implementation as part of openjdk but so far have not done so despite pressure from the community development on the icedtea plugin continues with the latest version of the nextgeneration plugin supporting googles chromium in addition to firefox since  development takes place in the separate icedteaweb project as of april  oracle has kept the codebase of the java plugin fully proprietary in contrast to the remainder of openjdk progress and availability from june  icedtea was able to build itself and pass a significant portion of mauve the gnu classpath test suite in may  support was added to icedtea for running the sun jtreg regression tests availability on several windows editions still remains unstable and unofficial icedtea has become popular among package maintainers for the following linux distributions currently as of april  architecture openjdk contained approximately on release in may   encumbered code which was only packaged as binary plugins these were required to build and use the jdk openjdk  was released with only  encumbered code and the encumbered sound support has also since been replaced icedtea is based on this release icedtea still provides its own web browser plugin and web start support as suns implementation remains proprietary icedtea x and x can compile openjdk using gnu classpathbased solutions such as gcj and optionally bootstraps itself using the hotspot java virtual machine and the javac java compiler it just built for now building icedtea x requires using icedtea x or x or an openjdk  or  build from another source platform support crossarchitecture ports of hotspot openjdks virtual machine are difficult because the code contains much assembly language in addition to the c core the icedtea project has developed a generic port of the hotspot interpreter called zeroassembler hotspot or zero with almost no assembly code this port is intended to allow the interpreter part of hotspot to be very easily adapted to any linux processor architecture the code of zeroassembler hotspot was used for all the nonx ports of hotspot ppc ia s and arm from version  of icedtea the icedtea project has also developed a platformindependent justintime compiler called shark for hotspot using llvm to complement zero this was included in upstream openjdk in august  a jit for arm was first included in  and  a native port to aarch from red hat appeared in  and a native ppc port from sapibm will be included in  the ppcaix port is included upstream in openjdk from version u and the aarch port will be included from version
