freeciv freeciv is a single and multiplayer turnbased strategy game for workstations and personal computers inspired by the proprietary sid meiers civilization series it is available for most desktop computer operating systems and available in an online browser based version released under the gnu general public license freeciv is free and open source software the games default settings are closest to civilization ii in both gameplay and graphics including the units and the isometric grid players take the role of tribal leaders in  bc who must guide their peoples through the centuries over time new technologies are discovered which allow the construction of new city buildings and the deployment of new units players can wage war on one another or form diplomatic relationships the game ends when one civilization has eradicated all others or accomplished the goal of space colonization or at a given deadline if more than one civilization remains at the deadline the player with the highest score wins points are awarded for the size of a civilization its wealth and cultural and scientific advances history at the computer science department at aarhus university three students avid players of xpilot and of sid meiers civilization which was a standalone pc game for msdos decided to find out whether the two could be fused into an xbased multiplayer civilizationlike strategy game the studentspeter unold claus leth gregersen and allan ove kjeldbjergstarted development in november  the first playable version was released in january  with bugfixing and small enhancements until april the rules of the game were close to civilization while the clientserver architecture was basically that of xpilot for the developers freeciv  was a successful proof of concept but a rather boring game so they went back to xpilot but freeciv was already playable and addictive enough to pick up other students as players bugfixers and feature extenders it was useful enough to be picked up by popular linux distributions eg debian designed to be portable it was ported to many platforms which helped its survival in  computer players were added that could soon beat newcomers to the game with ease using only minor forms of cheating the game grew in popularity a public server was installed that hosted games permanently archiving them and publishing a postgame analysis webpage including perplayer statistics and an animated map replay subsequent x releases improved the gui improved the gameplay and added many small features without causing a major change to how the game was best played incessant city building turned out to be a critical success factor developing larger cities did not appear worthwhile as many regular players reached excellent gaming skills diplomacy became essential so team games slowly started to replace freeforall games from around  version  released in  changed the game significantly by modifying various costs and benefits and adding some new game elements it made it worthwhile for players to develop only a few large cities full trade routes and advanced technologies this necessitated a distinct phase of rapturing under relatively peaceful conditions hence games were almost always played in teams and typically took longer to finish when compared to x games in  tcp and udp port number  was assigned to freeciv by iana freeciv is described as an example in the art of unix programming some studies and courses use freeciv as a platform for experimenting with the design and programming of intelligent agents design freeciv is very configurable down to the specific rules so it can be played in freeciv default mode civilization mode civilization ii mode or a custom mode one or several players act as game administrators and can configure the game rules typically modified rules are in order to play a game of freeciv a user must start up a freeciv client and connect it to a freeciv server initially the server is in pregame phase in this phase clients can connect and game configuration parameters can be changed at some point the server may be ordered to start a game in response it creates game players nations and the game map and assigns every player to either a freeciv client or a computer player as specified by the configuration from that point on the game will run until it ends or is terminated the server can never get back into pregame state the user can also start a game directly from the client this automatically starts a freeciv server connects to it and starts the game features freecivs graphics system is configurable originally map display was always in overhead mode like in civ i isometric mode like in civ ii and optionally hexagonal tiling like in civ v were added later in both modes look can be further customized by switching to an alternative set of graphics called a tileset the sounds can be replaced as well freeciv supports humantohuman multiplayer gameplay and artificial intelligence ai computer players while the game is turn based human players move simultaneously the ai players move separately partly at the start of a turn partly at the end in releases before  ai players could not engage in diplomatic relationships with human players under the current releases ai players will engage in a very predictable rulesbased diplomacy version  included a map editor termed civworld it can create new scenarios as well as edit the map currently being played basic scripting is available with freeciv but is not available in civworld version  increased the limit of players from  to  there are different clients available sdl gtk version and xawd the tests for version  started in  and include a qt client the freeciv interface is available in over  different languages the addition of gaelic was covered on bbc tv ports and variants originally developed on irix freeciv has been ported to many different operating systems it is distributed with many linux

freecivweb is a version of freeciv playable online in any modern web browser the game is a fork of the freeciv project with the goal of redesigning the desktop game into a version which can be played online freecivweb introduced several new features such as playbyemail support freely available to anyone online and support for playing the game on any realworld map location by choosing a map using mapbox which is not available in commercial games in the genre the games default settings are closest to civilization ii both in gameplay and graphics including the units and the isometric grid the proposal to create a webversion of freeciv was made  april  on the freeciv mailing lists and documented on the freecivorg wiki freecivweb was originally created by andreas rsdal but is now maintained by several freeciv developers on github freecivweb is free and open source software the freeciv c server is released under the gnu general public license while the freecivweb client is released under the gnu affero general public license freecivweb supports humantohuman multiplayer gameplay and artificial intelligence ai computer players its features are similar to the freeciv c client although not all of the userinterface has been ported from the c client yet freecivweb can be played online at playfreecivorg it was previously known and available at freecivnet all the features required to play a full game of freeciv are in place including rendering of an isometric map technology research and many dialogs for managing cities units and other players the game also supports scenariogames and includes maps of the world north america france italy japan and the iberian peninsula while the game is turn based human players move simultaneously the ai players move separately partly at the start of a turn partly at the end freecivweb can be played in any web browser which supports the html standards in particular the game uses the canvas element and websocket which are part of the html  standard unlike many other browserbased online games it does not depend on the proprietary flash plugin freecivweb is supported by mozilla firefox google chrome opera safari and internet explorer the canvas support in freecivweb has been used to benchmark html canvas performance longturn and greatturn freeciv longturn and greatturn are specialized extensions of freeciv featuring daylong game turns with large amounts of human opponents per map allowing for optimal timing to build up strategic plans and readapt them to the circumstances of each turn matches can last anytime from a few weeks to months and commonly involve  to  players in each one longturns first game now called lt started around  on the polish civilization fanpage civorgpl it was decided that the game is a bit too slow paced so a new x movement ruleset was devised  basically all units had their movement points and vision radius tripled as of september  the latest game was lt greatturns first game gt started in january  as of september  the most recent game was gt and the greatturn community generally uses x movement around  july  the greatturn website and servers were taken offline by its administrator the website and game data were acquired from the previous administrator and the website was restored around  september  longturn and greatturn are strongly focused on online communication for example greatturn provides a website where each player can create and manage a personal private forum and select the membership allowed to access it for reading or writing messages this infrastructure paves the ground for maximal cooperation between players allowing the arrangement of complex tactics and diplomacy contrarily to the classic freeciv the settings of each match are not determined from within the server hosting the match rather in greatturn any parameter definition or other proposition is published to the website via the greatturn voting system for public consideration and approbation this allows everybody to participate in decisions and doesnt force polls to conclude in a rush in longturn although a polls system was previously used changes to settings or rulesets are now discussed in the longturn forum
