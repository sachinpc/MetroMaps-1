gtkgnutella gtkgnutella is a peertopeer file sharing application which runs on the gnutella network gtkgnutella uses the gtk toolkit for its graphical user interface released under the gnu general public license gtkgnutella is free software history initially gtkgnutella was written to look like the original nullsoft gnutella client the original author yann grossel stopped working on the client in early  after a while raphael manfredi took over as the main software architect and the client has been in active development ever since versions released after july  do not look like the original nullsoft client features gtkgnutella is programmed in c with an emphasis on efficiency and portability without being minimalistic but rather headon with most of the modern features of the gnutella network therefore it requires fewer resources such as cpu andor ram than the major gnutella clients it can also be used as headless gnutella client not requiring gtk at all gtkgnutella has a filtering engine that can reduce the amount of spam and other irrelevant results gtkgnutella supports a large range of the features of modern gnutella clients gtkgnutella was the first gnutella client to support ipv and encryption using tls it can handle and export magnet links it has strong internationalization features supporting english german greek french hungarian spanish japanese norwegian dutch and chinese gtkgnutella also has support to prevent spamming and other hostile peer activity several software distributions provide precompiled packages but they are usually outdated as many distributions version freeze old stable releases the gnutella network benefits from running the latest version obtainable as peer and hostile ip address lists change rapidly making building the latest svn snapshot the best option there are also precompiled packages for many linux distributions available online persons concerned about security might wish to compile their own the gtkgnutella sources use dist as build and configuration system instead of autoconf most users are only familiar with the configure scripts generated by the latter another hazard for novices is configuring nat devices to enable full network connectivity for gtkgnutella gtkgnutella like any gnutella client is still usable behind a firewall or a router but with some reduced functionality if it cannot receive incoming tcp connections or udp packets in an attempt to mitigate the issue for newcomers gtkgnutalla implements the upnp and natpmp client protocols gtkgnutella supports features for downloading larger files videos programs and disk images version  supports tiger tree hash serving and versions after  support tiger tree hashes for uploads and downloads tiger tree hashing and other gtkgnutella features make file transfers as efficient as bittorrent specifically gtkgnutella supports partial file sharing remote queueing and files larger than  gib overlap checking was the only mechanism to guard against bad data prior to versions  overlap checking does not guard against malicious corruption like tiger tree hashing does version  introduced preliminary support for a kademlia dht which was completed in version  the dht is replacing search by sha when locating alternate sources for a known file or looking for pushproxies in version  the dht is enabled by default limewire first developed the dht and named it mojito dht version  introduced full native support for upnp and natpmp making the usage behind a compatible router much easier since there is no longer any need to manually forward ports on the firewall in this version the code was also ported to microsoft windows however the windows port is still considered beta due to lack of wide testing so far version  also introduced important dht protection against sybil attacks using algorithms based on statistical properties version  was a major release introducing clientside support for http pipelining whats new queries mime type query filtering guess support gnutella udp extension for scalable searches and partial file querying although many gnutella vendors already supported serverside guess gtkgnutella introduced the clientside as well also enhancing the original specifications of the protocol to make it truly usable version  employs a minor patch to correct malloc memory allocations and multiple threads issues mainly on ubuntu  operating systems this  gtkgnutella version was also dedicated to the memory of dennis ritchie  version  added rudp reliable udp and improved partial file transfers version  is a major release which added g support gtkgnutella will now connect to the g network in leaf mode this allows searches from g nodes and lets local queries be propagated to the g network as well file exchanges with g hosts are fully interoperable and are permitted without restriction popularity gtkgnutella does not rank as one of the most popular clients on gnutellanet crawls gtkgnutella developers proposals have been incorporated into many gnutella clients in  gtkgnutella vendor extensions are the third most prolific on the gdf gnutella developer forum following limewire and bearshare salon listed gtkgnutella as one of the five most popular gnutella applications in  xolox and toadnode also in the list are no longer actively developed
