interface java an interface in the java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behaviour that classes must implement they are similar to protocols interfaces are declared using the codice keyword and may only contain method signature and constant declarations variable declarations that are declared to be both codice and codice all methods of an interface do not contain implementation method bodies as of all versions below java  starting with java  codice and codice methods may have implementation in the codice definition interfaces cannot be instantiated but rather are implemented a class that implements an interface must implement all of the methods described in the interface or be an abstract class object references in java may be specified to be of an interface type in each case they must either be null or be bound to an object that implements the interface one benefit of using interfaces is that they simulate multiple inheritance all classes in java must have exactly one base class the only exception being the root class of the java type system multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed however an interface may inherit multiple interfaces and a class may implement multiple interfaces overview interfaces are used to encode similarities which the classes of various types share but do not necessarily constitute a class relationship for instance a human and a parrot can both whistle however it would not make sense to represent codices and codices as subclasses of a codice class rather they would most likely be subclasses of an codice class likely with intermediate classes but both would implement the codice interface another use of interfaces is being able to use an object without knowing its type of class but rather only that it implements a certain interface for instance if one were annoyed by a whistling noise one may not know whether it is a human or a parrot because all that could be determined is that a whistler is whistling the call codice will call the implemented method codice of object codice no matter what class it has provided it implements codice in a more practical example a sorting algorithm may expect an object of type  thus without knowing the specific type it knows that objects of that type can somehow be sorted for example usage defining an interface interfaces are defined with the following syntax compare to javas class definition example public interface interface extends interface the body of the interface contains abstract methods but since all methods in an interface are by definition abstract the codice keyword is not required since the interface specifies a set of exposed behaviors all methods are implicitly codice thus a simple interface may be the member type declarations in an interface are implicitly static final and public but otherwise they can be any type of class or interface implementing interfaces in a class the syntax for implementing an interface uses this formula classes may implement an interface for example if a class implements an interface and does not implement all its methods it must be marked as codice if a class is abstract one of its subclasses is expected to implement its unimplemented methods although if any of the abstract class subclasses does not implement all interface methods the subclass itself must be marked again as codice classes can implement multiple interfaces interfaces are commonly used in the java language for callbacks java does not allow the passing of methods procedures as arguments therefore the practice is to define an interface and use it as the argument and use the method signature knowing that the signature will be later implemented subinterfaces interfaces can extend several other interfaces using the same formula as described below for example is legal and defines a subinterface note how it allows multiple inheritance unlike classes note also that codice and codice may possibly define or inherit methods with the same signature say codice when a class implements codice it will implement both methods simultaneously examples some common java interfaces are
