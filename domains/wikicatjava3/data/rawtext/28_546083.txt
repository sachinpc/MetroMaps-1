processing programming language processing is an open source computer programming language and integrated development environment ide built for the electronic arts new media art and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks the project was initiated in  by casey reas and benjamin fry both formerly of the aesthetics and computation group at the mit media lab in  they started the processing foundation along with daniel shiffman who joined as a third project lead one of the aims of processing is to allow nonprogrammers to start computer programming aided by visual feedback the processing language builds on the java language but uses a simplified syntax and a graphics user interface features processing includes a sketchbook a minimal alternative to an integrated development environment ide for organizing projects every processing sketch is actually a subclass of the codice java class which implements most of the processing languages features when programming in processing all additional classes defined will be treated as inner classes when the code is translated into pure java before compiling this means that the use of static variables and methods in classes is prohibited unless you explicitly tell processing that you want to code in pure java mode processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the papplet sketch this allows for complex data types that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as int integer char character float real number and color rgb argb hex examples hello world the simplest possible version of a hello world program in processing is however due to the more visuallyoriented nature of processing the following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language united states presidential election map the next example creates a map of the results of the  usa presidential election blue denotes states won by barack obama and red denotes those won by john mccain note this map does not show the nebraska district in which obama won an elector processing v or above is required to run this example related projects processing is not a single language but rather an artsoriented approach to learning teaching and making things with code there are several variants and related projects design by numbers processing was based on the original work done on design by numbers project at mit it shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment wiring arduino and fritzing processing has spawned another project wiring which uses the processing ide with a collection of libraries written in the c language as a way to teach artists how to program microcontrollers there are now two separate hardware projects wiring and arduino using the wiring environment and language fritzing is another software environment of the same sort which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product mobile processing another spinoff project now defunct is mobile processing by francis li which allowed software written using the processing language and environment to run on java powered mobile devices today some of the same functionality is provided by processing itself processingjs in  john resig ported processing to javascript using the canvas element for rendering allowing processing to be used in modern web browsers without the need for a java plugin since then the open source community including students at seneca college in toronto have taken over the project processingjs is also used to advocate very basic programming to students of all ages on khan academy by creating drawings and animations learners showcase their creations to other learners pjs lauren mccarthy has created pjs a native javascript alternative to processingjs that has the official support of the processing foundation mccarthy also teaches an introductory course to pjs on kadenze processingpy python mode for processing or processingpy is a python interface to the underlying java toolkit it was chiefly developed by jonathan feinberg with contributions from james gilles and ben alkov iprocessing iprocessing was built to help people develop native iphone applications using the processing language it is an integration of the processingjs library and a javascript application framework for iphone spde spde standing for scala processing development environment replaces processings reduced java syntax and custom preprocessor with the offtheshelf scala programming language which also runs on the java platform and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods while also allowing more concise code and supporting functional programming quil quil formerly named cljprocessing is a wrapper for processing in the clojure language a lisp that runs on the java platform awards in  reas and fry won the prestigious golden nica award from ars electronica in its net vision category for their work on processing ben fry won the  national design award given by the smithsonian cooperhewitt national design museum in the category of interaction design the award statement says drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science ben fry pursues a longheld fascination with visualizing data as principal of fathom information design in boston fry develops software printed works installations and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents with casey reas he founded the processing project an opensource programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactivemedia software it provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts license processings core libraries the code included in exported applications and applets is licensed under the gnu lesser general public license allowing users to release their original code with a choice of license the ide is licensed under the gnu general public license name originally processing had the url at proceingnet because the processing domain was taken eventually reas and fry acquired the domain although the name had a combination of letters and numbers it was still pronounced processing they do not prefer the environment being referred to as proceing despite the domain name change processing still uses the term p sometimes as a shortened name p specifically is used not p
