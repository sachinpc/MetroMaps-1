simulink simulink developed by mathworks is a graphical programming environment for modeling simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamic systems its primary interface is a graphical block diagramming tool and a customizable set of block libraries it offers tight integration with the rest of the matlab environment and can either drive matlab or be scripted from it simulink is widely used in automatic control and digital signal processing for multidomain simulation and modelbased design addon products mathworks and other thirdparty hardware and software products can be used with simulink for example stateflow extends simulink with a design environment for developing state machines and flow charts mathworks claims that coupled with another of their products simulink can automatically generate c source code for realtime implementation of systems as the efficiency and flexibility of the code improves this is becoming more widely adopted for production systems in addition to being a tool for embedded system design work because of its flexibility and capacity for quick iteration embedded coder creates code efficient enough for use in embedded systems simulink realtime formerly known as xpc target together with xbased realtime systems is an environment for simulating and testing simulink and stateflow models in realtime on the physical system another mathworks product also supports specific embedded targets when used with other generic products simulink and stateflow can automatically generate synthesizable vhdl and verilog simulink verification and validation enables systematic verification and validation of models through modeling style checking requirements traceability and model coverage analysis simulink design verifier uses formal methods to identify design errors like integer overflow division by zero and dead logic and generates test case scenarios for model checking within the simulink environment the systematic testing tool tpt is marketed as a way to perform a formal verification and validation process to stimulate simulink models but also for use during the development phase where the developer generates inputs to test the system by the substitution of the constant and signal generator blocks of simulink mathworks claim that the stimulation becomes reproducible simevents is used to add a library of graphical building blocks for modeling queuing systems to the simulink environment and to add an eventbased simulation engine to the timebased simulation engine in simulink therefore in simulink any type of simulation can be done and the model can be simulated at any point in this environment different type of blocks can be accessed using the simulink library browser and therefore the benefit could be taken out from this environment efficiently
