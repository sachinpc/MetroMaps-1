gist feature at a punk rock ruby conference in  gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a pastebin by adding version control for code snippets easy forking and ssl encryption for private pastes because each gist has its own git repository multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using git further forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch so gists pastes can become more like miniprojects education program github launched a new program called the github student developer pack to give students free
