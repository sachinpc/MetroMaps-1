couchdb apache couchdb is open source database software that focuses on ease of use and having an architecture that completely embraces the web it has a documentoriented nosql database architecture and is implemented in the concurrencyoriented language erlang it uses json to store data javascript as its query language using mapreduce and http for an api couchdb was first released in  and later became an apache software foundation project in  unlike a relational database a couchdb database does not store data and relationships in tables instead each database is a collection of independent documents each document maintains its own data and selfcontained schema an application may access multiple databases such as one stored on a users mobile phone and another on a server document metadata contains revision information making it possible to merge any differences that may have occurred while the databases were disconnected couchdb implements a form of multiversion concurrency control mvcc so it does not lock the database file during writes conflicts are left to the application to resolve resolving a conflict generally involves first merging data into one of the documents then deleting the stale one other features include documentlevel acid semantics with eventual consistency incremental mapreduce and incremental replication one of couchdbs distinguishing features is multimaster replication which allows it to scale across machines to build high performance systems a builtin web application called futon helps with administration history couch is an acronym for cluster of unreliable commodity hardware the couchdb project was created in april  by damien katz former lotus notes developer at ibm he selffunded the project for almost two years and released it as an open source project under the gnu general public license in february  it became an apache incubator project and was offered under the apache license instead a few months after it graduated to a toplevel project this led to the first stable version being released in july  in early  katz left the project to focus on couchbase server since katzs departure the apache couchdb project has continued releasing  in april  and  in april  in july  the couchdb community merged the codebase for bigcouch cloudants clustered version of couchdb into the apache project the bigcouch clustering framework is prepared to be included in an upcoming release of apache couchdb native clustering is supported at version  and the new mango query server provides a simple jsonbased way to perform couchdb queries without javascript or mapreduce couchdb also offers a builtin administration interface accessible via web called futon use cases and production deployments replication and synchronization capabilities of couchdb make it ideal for using it in mobile devices where network connection is not guaranteed but the application must keep on working offline couchdb is well suited for applications with accumulating occasionally changing data on which predefined queries are to be run and where versioning is important crm cms systems by example mastermaster replication is an especially interesting feature allowing easy multisite deployments users users of couchdb include data manipulation documents and views couchdb manages a collection of json documents the documents are organised via views views are defined with aggregate functions and filters are computed in parallel much like mapreduce views are generally stored in the database and their indexes updated continuously couchdb supports a view system using external socket servers and a jsonbased protocol as a consequence view servers have been developed in a variety of languages javascript is the default but there are also php ruby python and erlang accessing data via http applications interact with couchdb via http the following demonstrates a few examples using curl a commandline utility these examples assume that couchdb is running on localhost  on port  open source components couchdb includes a number of other open source projects as part of its default package
