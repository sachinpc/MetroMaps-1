threejs threejs is a crossbrowser javascript libraryapi used to create and display animated d computer graphics in a web browser threejs uses webgl the source code is hosted in a repository on github overview threejs allows the creation of gpuaccelerated d animations using the javascript language as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins this is possible thanks to the advent of webgl highlevel libraries such as threejs or glge scenejs philogl or a number of other libraries make it possible to author complex d computer animations that display in the browser without the effort required for a traditional standalone application or a plugin history threejs was first released by ricardo cabello to github in april  the origins of the library can be traced back to his involvement with the demoscene in the early s the code was first developed in actionscript then in  ported to javascript in cabellos mind the two strong points for the transfer to javascript were not having to compile the code before each run and platform independence with the advent of webgl paul brunt was able to add the renderer for this quite easily as threejs was designed with the rendering code as a module rather than in the core itself cabellos contributions include api design canvasrenderer svgrenderer and being responsible for merging the commits by the various contributors into the project the second contributor in terms of commits branislav ulicny started with threejs in  after having posted a number of webgl demos on his own site he wanted webgl renderer capabilities in threejs to exceed those of canvasrenderer or svgrenderer his major contributions generally involve materials shaders and postprocessing soon after the introduction of webgl on firefox  in march  joshua koo came on board he built his first threejs demo for d text in september  his contributions frequently relate to geometry generation there are over  contributors in total features threejs includes the following features threejs runs in all browsers supported by webgl threejs is made available under the mit license usage the threejs library is a single javascript file it can be included within a web page by linking to a local or remote copy the following code creates a scene adds a camera and a cube to the scene creates a webgl renderer and adds its viewport in the documentbody element once loaded the cube rotates about its x and yaxis selected uses and works the threejs library is being used for a wide variety of applications and purposes the following lists identify selected uses and works community online ides with builtin support for threejs are available at webgl playground html snippet and jsfiddle documentation is available for the api as well as general advice on the wiki support for developers committing to the library is provided via the issues forum on github while support for developers building apps and web pages is provided via stackoverflow realtime online support is provided using irc via freenode most of the developers are also on twitter bibliography a number of computer science textbooks refer to threejs as a tool for simplifying the development process for webgl applications as well as an easy method for becoming familiar with the concepts of webgl these textbooks in order of appearance include
