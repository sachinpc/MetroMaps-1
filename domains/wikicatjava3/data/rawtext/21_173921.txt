gift gift internet file transfer gift is a computer software daemon that allows several file sharing protocols to be used with a simple client having a graphical user interface gui the client dynamically loads plugins implementing the protocols as they are required general clients implementing frontends for the gift daemon communicate with its process using a lightweight network protocol this allows the networking protocol code to be completely abstracted from the user interface the gift daemon is written using relatively crossplatform c code which means that it can be compiled for and executed on a big variety of operating systems there are several gift gui frontends for microsoft windows apple macintosh and unixlike operating systems the name gift gift internet file transfer is a socalled recursive acronym which means that it refers to itself in the expression for which it stands one of the biggest drawbacks of the gift engine is that it currently lacks unicode support which prevents sharing files with unicode characters in their file names such as    etc also gift lacks many features needed to use the gnutella network effectively available plugins available protocols are openft protocol gifts sibling project is openft a peertopeer file sharing network protocol that has a structure in which nodes are divided into search nodes and index supernodes in addition to common nodes since both projects are related very closely when one says openft one can mean either one of two different things the openft protocol or the implementation in the form of a plugin for gift the name openft stands for open fasttrack despite this the openft protocol is an entirely new protocol design only a few ideas in the openft protocol are drawn from what little was known about the fasttrack protocol at the time openft was designed openft file sharing protocol like fasttrack and napster openft is a network where nodes submit lists of shared files to other nodes to keep track of which files are available on the network this reduces the bandwidth consumed from search requests at the price of additional memory and processing power on the nodes that store that information the transmission of shared lists is not fully recursive a node will only transmit its list of shared files to a single search node randomly chosen as that nodes parent and the list of those files will not be further transmitted to other nodes openft is also similar to the gnutella network in that search requests are recursively forwarded in between the nodes that keep track of the shared files there are three different kinds of nodes on the openft network a node can be both a search and an index node user nodes will pick three search nodes to be their parent nodes they will submit their shares list to them if the parent accepts the user as its child by default search nodes will be parents for a maximum of  child nodes
