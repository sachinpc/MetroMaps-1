edonkey edonkey nicknamed edk is a peertopeer file sharing application developed by us company metamachine using the multisource file transfer protocol the edonkey client supports both the edonkey network and the overnet network on september   edonkey was discontinued following a cease and desist letter from the riaa further info on the case edonkey network users on the edonkey network predominantly share large files of tens or hundreds of megabytes such as cd images videos games and software programs to ease file searching some websites list the checksums of soughtafter files in the form of an edk link some of those websites also have lists of active servers for users to update metamachines has also created another filesharing network called overnet which interoperates with the edonkey network but without the use of servers most edonkey clients also now use the overnet network in  metamachines announced it would stop development of overnet to concentrate on edonkey though the edonkey client now includes the overnet protocol edonkey has been closed down and if the user attempts to visit the site heshe will be shown a screen stating that edonkey is unavailable and that the users ip address has been logged early history and design edonkey was created by jed mccaleb cofounder of stellar payment network and was first released on september   on september   client and server versions were available for microsoft windows and linux compared to earlier pp filesharing program napster edonkey featured swarming downloads meaning that clients could download different pieces of a single file from different peers effectively utilizing the combined bandwidth of all of the peers instead of being limited to the bandwidth of a single peer at first servers were isolated from one another as with napster but later versions of the edonkey server software enabled servers to form a search network this allowed servers to forward search queries from their locally connected clients to other servers allowing clients to effectively find peers connected to any server on the server network thereby increasing download swarm size it also allowed clients to find and download files not available from clients connected to the same server a third improvement compared to napster was the use of file hashes instead of simple filenames in search results file searches initiated by the user were keywordbased and matched against the filename list stored on the edonkey server but the server returned a list of filenames paired with the hash values of those files to the client when selecting a file from the list presented to the user the client would actually initiate a download by hash value this meant that a file could have many different filenames across different peers but would be considered identical for purposes of downloading if its hash was the same the twolevel client and server peertopeer network architecture offered a balance between centralized systems like napster and decentralized systems like gnutella where napster ultimately proved to be vulnerable was its centralized server cluster which was a stable target for legal action gnutellas original design featuring total elimination of the server network in favor of purely peertopeer searching quickly proved to be infeasible due to massive search traffic overhead between peers later ndlevel pp file sharing systems use a similar design to edonkey downloading files in pieces by hash from multiple peers simultaneously but innovate in the design of the server network such as in the case of bittorrent which separates the file search feature torrent search from the download peer locating feature torrent tracker edonkey client the latest version of the official edonkey client included a plugin that allowed bittorrent files to be downloaded once a torrent download begins the search facility within edonkey can find the same file within the edonkeyovernet network and synchronise its download this effectively allowed a torrent to be used as another source for the download vastly increasing speed as well as virtually eliminating problems with fakes torrents are very clean in terms of falsely labelled files and their use as file size verifiers in addition to edonkeys own userbased fake warning system has vastly improved the networks functionality by effectively combining the range of the existing overnet and edonkey networks with the lightningfast file distribution of the bittorrent system edonkey was following a growing trend amongst peertopeer programmes of integrating downloads from multiple networks this has the advantage of maximising the number of files available while limiting vulnerability to problems on a single network edonkey sued by riaa in september  officials from the company metamachine received a cease and desist letter from the riaa as a result of the june  supreme court ruling mgm studios v grokster that makers of software that facilitates copyright infringement are liable for that infringement many news sites reported that on september   metamachines corporate offices have closed this was apparently inaccurate based on the aforementioned news sites checking for the old edonkey headquarters in new york the new ones being in new jersey as they had moved there however on september   edonkey officially closed its doors metamachine president sam yagan said in a statement that the company would convert edonkeys user base to an online content retailer operating in a closed pp environment and such a transaction to take place as soon as we can reach a settlement with the riaa this had little effect on the network as a whole as edonkey clients only made up a small minority of the whole network on september   it was reported that metamachine inc had agreed to settle with the riaa for  million and the website is replaced by a text advertisement reflecting the riaas interpretation of copyright law nevertheless the edonkey network is still available through other clients such as emule or amule
