couchbase server couchbase server originally known as membase is an opensource distributed sharednothing architecture multimodel nosql documentoriented database software package that is optimized for interactive applications these applications may serve many concurrent users by creating storing retrieving aggregating manipulating and presenting data in support of these kinds of application needs couchbase server is designed to provide easytoscale keyvalue or json document access with low latency and high sustained throughput it is designed to be clustered from a single machine to very largescale deployments spanning many machines a version originally called couchbase lite was later marketed as couchbase mobile combined with other software couchbase server provided client protocol compatibility with memcached but added disk persistence data replication live cluster reconfiguration rebalancing and multitenancy with data partitioning product history membase was developed by several leaders of the memcached project who had founded a company northscale to develop a keyvalue store with the simplicity speed and scalability of memcached but also provided the storage persistence and querying capabilities of a database the original membase source code was contributed by northscale and project cosponsors zynga and naver corporation then known as nhn to a new project on membaseorg in june  on february   the membase project founders and membase inc announced a merger with couchone a company with many of the principal players behind couchdb with an associated project merger the merged company was called couchbase inc in january  couchbase released couchbase server  in september  orbitz said moved some of its systems to use couchbase on december  couchbase server  announced in july  and released in december  included a new json document store indexing and querying incremental mapreduce and replication across data centers architecture every couchbase node consists of a data service index service query service and cluster manager component starting with the  release the three services can be distributed to run on separate nodes of the cluster if needed in the parlance of eric brewers cap theorem couchbase is normally a cp type system meaning it provides consistency and partition tolerance or it can be set up as an ap system with multiple clusters cluster manager the cluster manager supervises the configuration and behavior of all the servers in a couchbase cluster it configures and supervises internode behavior like managing replication streams and rebalancing operations it also provides metric aggregation and consensus functions for the cluster and a restful cluster management interface the cluster manager uses the erlang programming language and the open telecom platform replication and failover data replication within the nodes of a cluster can be controlled with several parameters in december  replication was also supported between different data centers data manager the data manager stores and retries documents in response to data operations from applications it asynchronously writes data to disk after acknowledging to the client in version  and later applications can optionally ensure data is written to more than one server or to disk before acknowledging a write to the client parameters define item ages that affect when data is persisted and how max memory and migration from mainmemory to disk is handled it supports working sets greater than a memory quota per node or bucket external systems can subscribe to filtered data streams supporting for example full text search indexing data analytics or archiving data format a document is the most basic unit of data manipulation in couchbase server documents are stored in json document format with no predefined schemas objectmanaged cache couchbase server includes a builtin multithreaded objectmanaged cache that implements memcached compatible apis such as get set delete append prepend etc storage engine couchbase server has a tailappend storage design that is immune to data corruption oom killers or sudden loss of power data is written to the data file in an appendonly manner which enables couchbase to do mostly sequential writes for update and provide an optimized access patterns for disk io performance a performance benchmark done by altoros in  compared couchbase server with other technologies cisco systems published a benchmark that measured the latency and throughput of couchbase server with a mixed workload in  licensing and support couchbase server is a packaged version of couchbases open source software technology and is available in a community edition without recent bug fixes with apache  license and an edition for commercial use couchbase server builds are available for ubuntu debian red hat suse oracle linux microsoft windows and mac os x operating systems couchbase has supported software developers kits for the programming languages net php ruby python c nodejs java and go nql a query language called the nonfirst normal form query language nql pronounced nickel is used for finding data in the server it was announced in march  as sql for documents the nql data model is nonfirst normal form nnf with support for nested attributes and domainoriented normalization the nql data model is also a proper superset and generalization of the relational model
