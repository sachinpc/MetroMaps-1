rmiiiop rmiiiop read as rmi over iiop denotes the java remote method invocation rmi interface over the internet interorb protocol iiop which delivers common object request broker architecture corba distributed computing capabilities to the java platform it was initially based on two specifications the java language mapping to omg idl and corbaiiop  with features inherited from corba software components that work together can be written in multiple computer languages and run on multiple computers in other words it supports multiple platforms and can make remote procedure calls to execute subroutines on another computer as defined by rmi history the java rmiiiop specification was created to simplify the development of corba applications while preserving all major benefits it was developed by sun microsystems and ibm combining features of java rmi technology with features of corba technology specification rmiiiop uses generated code for remote objects and does not require supplementary classes for nontrivial data unlike corba this results in less complexity and a smaller footprint both corba and rmiiiop utilize the general interorb protocol communication standard rmiiiop is largely based on the object by value concept that serves as a container or direct replacement for corba structures unions sequences arrays and strings no separate idl is necessary instead the data structure definitions are discovered automatically via reflection mechanisms however it is possible to generate the idl definitions for the involved rmiiiop data structures and use these definitions to exercise finer control between rmiiiop and corba communicating partners recent versions of rmiiiop derive their servants from the standard codice class hence it is possible to connect them to a corba orb manually involving one or more of portable object adapters portable interceptors corba naming services along with other standard corba features
