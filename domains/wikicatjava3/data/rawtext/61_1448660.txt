java opengl java opengl jogl is a wrapper library that allows opengl to be used in the java programming language it was originally developed by kenneth bradley russell and christopher john kline and was further developed by the sun microsystems game technology group since  it has been an independent open source project under a bsd license it is the reference implementation for java bindings for opengl jsr jogl allows access to most opengl features available to c language programs through the use of the java native interface jni it offers access to both the standard gl functions along with the glu functions however the opengl utility toolkit glut library is not available for windowsystem related calls as java has its own windowing systems abstract window toolkit awt swing and some extensions design the base opengl c api as well as its associated windowing api are accessed in jogl via java native interface jni calls as such the underlying system must support opengl for jogl to work jogl differs from some other java opengl wrapper libraries in that it merely exposes the procedural opengl api via methods on a few classes rather than trying to map opengl functionality onto the objectoriented programming paradigm indeed most of the jogl code is autogenerated from the opengl c header files via a conversion tool named gluegen which was programmed specifically to facilitate the creation of jogl this design decision has both its advantages and disadvantages the procedural and state machine nature of opengl is inconsistent with the typical method of programming under java which is bothersome to many programmers however the straightforward mapping of the opengl c api to java methods makes conversion of existing c applications and example code much simpler the thin layer of abstraction provided by jogl makes runtime execution quite efficient but accordingly is more difficult to code compared to higherlevel abstraction libraries like javad because most of the code is autogenerated changes to opengl can be rapidly added to jogl status and standardization  jogl provides full access to the opengl  specification as well as almost all vendor extensions and opencl openmax and openal the  version is the reference implementation for jsr java bindings for opengl the  release gave limited access to glu nurbs providing rendering of curved lines and surfaces via the traditional glu apis the  release added support for opengl versions up to  and opengl es versions up to  wayland and vulkan support is planned javadopengl interoperability since the java se  version of the java language javad the api for drawing two dimensional graphics in java and jogl have become interoperable allowing it to  tutorials  opengl es  sample  gl and gl hello triangle and hello texture  java opengl sample pack porting of gtruc opengl sample pack the over  samples illustrate almost all opengl features ranging from es  up to the last gl extensions same of them usually also called azdo almost zero driver overhead  modernjoglsamples java porting of learning modern d graphics programming jason l mckesson  immediate mode sample simplest example using the fixed pipeline
