python programming language python is a widely used highlevel generalpurpose interpreted dynamic programming language its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as c or java the language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale python supports multiple programming paradigms including objectoriented imperative and functional programming or procedural styles it features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library python interpreters are available for many operating systems allowing python code to run on a wide variety of systems using thirdparty tools such as pyexe or pyinstaller python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems so pythonbased software can be distributed to and used on those environments with no need to install a python interpreter cpython the reference implementation of python is free and opensource software and has a communitybased development model as do nearly all of its variant implementations cpython is managed by the nonprofit python software foundation history python was conceived in the late s and its implementation began in december  by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde  informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to the abc language itself inspired by setl capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system amoeba van rossum is pythons principal author and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of python is reflected in the title given to him by the python community benevolent dictator for life bdfl about the origin of python van rossum wrote in  python  was released on  october  and had many major new features including a cycledetecting garbage collector and support for unicode with this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and communitybacked python  which early in its development was commonly referred to as python  or pyk a major backwardsincompatible release was released on  december  after a long period of testing many of its major features have been backported to the backwardscompatible python x and x version series features and philosophy python is a multiparadigm programming language objectoriented programming and structured programming are fully supported and many language features support functional programming and aspectoriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods many other paradigms are supported via extensions including design by contract and logic programming python uses dynamic typing and a mix of reference counting and a cycledetecting garbage collector for memory management an important feature of python is dynamic name resolution late binding which binds method and variable names during program execution the design of python offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition the language has map reduce and filter functions list comprehensions dictionaries and sets and generator expressions the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml the core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document the zen of python pep  which includes aphorisms such as rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the languages core python was designed to be highly extensible python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface this design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by van rossum from the start because of his frustrations with abc which espoused the opposite mindset while offering choice in coding methodology the python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax such as in perl in favor of a sparser lesscluttered grammar as alex martelli put it to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture pythons philosophy rejects the perl there is more than one way to do it approach to language design in favor of there should be oneand preferably only oneobvious way to do it pythons developers strive to avoid premature optimization and moreover reject patches to noncritical parts of cpython that would offer a marginal increase in speed at the cost of clarity when speed is important a python programmer can move timecritical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c or try using pypy a justintime compiler cython is also available which translates a python script into c and makes direct clevel api calls into the python interpreter an important goal of pythons developers is making it fun to use this is reflected in the origin of the name which comes from monty python and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar a common neologism in the python community is pythonic which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well that it is natural or shows fluency in the language that it conforms with pythons minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability in contrast code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic users and admirers of python especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced are often referred to as pythonists pythonistas and pythoneers syntax and semantics python is intended to be a highly readable language it is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout often using english keywords where other languages use punctuation further python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal indentation python uses whitespace indentation to delimit blocks  rather than curly braces or keywords an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block this feature is also sometimes termed the offside rule statements and control flow pythons statements include among others python does not support tail call optimization or firstclass continuations and according to guido van rossum it never will however better support for coroutinelike functionality is provided in  by extending pythons generators before  generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator as of python  it is possible to pass information back into a generator function and as of python  the information can be passed through multiple stack levels expressions some python expressions are similar to languages such as c and java while some are not in python a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced in contrast to languages such as common lisp scheme or ruby this leads to duplicating some functionality for example statements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions all being expressions cannot contain statements a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as codice cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator codice for an equality operator codice in conditions codice is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but codice causes a syntax error in python methods methods on objects are functions attached to the objects class the syntax codice is for normal methods and functions syntactic sugar for codice python methods have an explicit codice parameter to access instance data in contrast to the implicit codice or codice in some other objectoriented programming languages eg c java objectivec or ruby typing python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names type constraints are not checked at compile time rather operations on an object may fail signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type despite being dynamically typed python is strongly typed forbidding operations that are not welldefined for example adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them python allows programmers to define their own types using classes which are most often used for objectoriented programming new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example codice or codice and the classes are instances of the metaclass codice itself an instance of itself allowing metaprogramming and reflection before version  python had two kinds of classes oldstyle and newstyle oldstyle classes were eliminated in python  making all classes newstyle in versions between  and  both kinds of classes could be used the syntax of both styles is the same the difference being whether the class codice is inherited from directly or indirectly all newstyle classes inherit from codice and are instances of codice mathematics python has the usual c arithmetic operators codice codice codice codice codice it also has codice for exponentiation eg codice and codice and a new matrix multiply codice operator is included in version  the behavior of division has changed significantly over time rounding towards negative infinity though different from most languages adds consistency for instance it means that the equation codice is always true it also means that the equation codice is valid for both positive and negative values of codice however maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of codice is as expected in the halfopen interval  b where codice is a positive integer it has to lie in the interval b  when codice is negative python provides a codice function for rounding a float to the nearest integer for tiebreaking versions before  use roundawayfromzero codice is  codice is  python  uses round to even codice is  codice is  python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics for example the expression codice tests whether codice is less than codice and codice is less than codice cderived languages interpret this expression differently in c the expression would first evaluate codice resulting in  or  and that result would then be compared with codice python has extensive builtin support for arbitrary precision arithmetic integers are transparently switched from the machinesupported maximum fixedprecision usually  or  bits belonging to the python type codice to arbitrary precision belonging to the python type codice where needed the latter have an l suffix in their textual representation the codice typeclass in module codice since version  provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes the codice type in module codice since version  provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers due to pythons extensive mathematics library it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation libraries python has a large standard library commonly cited as one of pythons greatest strengths providing tools suited to many tasks this is deliberate and has been described as a batteries included python philosophy for internetfacing applications many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported modules for creating graphical user interfaces connecting to relational databases pseudorandom number generators arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals manipulating regular expressions and doing unit testing are also included some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation codice follows pep  but most modules are not they are specified by their code internal documentation and test suite if supplied however because most of the standard library is crossplatform python code only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations the standard library is not needed to run python or embed it in an application for example blender  omits most of the standard library as of august  the python package index the official repository of thirdparty software for python contains over  packages offering a wide range of functionality including development environments most python implementations including cpython can function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives the results immediately readevalprint loop repl in short python acts as a commandline interface or shell other shells add abilities beyond those in the basic interpreter including idle and ipython while generally following the visual style of the python shell they implement features like autocompletion session state retention and syntax highlighting in addition to standard desktop integrated development environments python ides there are also web browserbased ides sagemath intended for developing science and mathrelated python programs and a browserbased ide and hosting environment pythonanywhere additionally the canopy ide is also an option for creating python programs implementations the main python implementation named cpython is written in c meeting the c standard it compiles python programs into intermediate bytecode which is executed by the virtual machine cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and python it is available in versions for many platforms including windows and most modern unixlike systems cpython was intended from almost its very conception to be crossplatform pypy is a fast compliant interpreter of python  and  its justintime compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython a version taking advantage of multicore processors using software transactional memory is being created stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the c memory stack thus allowing massively concurrent programs pypy also has a stackless version micropython is a lean fast python  variant that is optimised to run on microcontrollers other justintime compilers have been developed in the past but are now unsupported in  nokia released a python interpreter for the series  mobile phones named pys it includes many of the modules from the cpython implementations and some added modules to integrate with the symbian operating system this project has been kept up to date to run on all variants of the s platform and there are several third party modules available the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries with the feature that programs can be both written and run on the target device there are several compilers to highlevel object languages with either unrestricted python a restricted subset of python or a language similar to python as the source language a performance comparison of various python implementations on a nonnumerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy  development pythons development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process the pep process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features for collecting community input on an issue and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into python outstanding peps are reviewed and commented upon by the python community and by van rossum the python projects benevolent dictator for life enhancement of the language goes along with development of the cpython reference implementation the mailing list pythondev is the primary forum for discussion about the languages development specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker maintained at pythonorg development takes place on a selfhosted source code repository running mercurial cpythons public releases come in three types distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented many alpha beta and releasecandidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases although there is a rough schedule for each release this is often pushed back if the code is not ready the development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development and using the buildbot continuous integration system the community of python developers has also contributed over  software modules as of august   to the python package index pypi the official repository of thirdparty libraries for python the major academic conference on python is named pycon there are special mentoring programmes like the pyladies naming pythons name is derived from the television series monty pythons flying circus and it is common to use monty python references in example code for example the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar also the official python documentation often contains various obscure monty python references the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pys an implementation for the symbian s operating system pyqt and pygtk which bind qt and gtk respectively to python and pypy a python implementation originally written in python uses since  python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages as measured by the tiobe programming community index as of august  it is the fifth most popular language it was ranked as programming language of the year for the year  and  it is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on c eg c objectivec note c and java only have partial syntactic similarity to c such as the use of curly braces and are closer in similarity to each other than c an empirical study found scripting languages such as python more productive than conventional languages such as c and java for a programming problem involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c large organizations that make use of python include wikipedia google yahoo cern nasa and some smaller ones like ilm and ita the social news networking site reddit is written entirely in python python can serve as a scripting language for web applications eg via modwsgi for the apache web server with web server gateway interface a standard api has evolved to facilitate these applications web frameworks like django pylons pyramid turbogears webpy tornado flask bottle and zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications pyjamas and ironpython can be used to develop the clientside of ajaxbased applications sqlalchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database twisted is a framework to program communications between computers and is used for example by dropbox libraries like numpy scipy and matplotlib allow the effective use of python in scientific computing with specialized libraries such as biopython and astropy providing domainspecific functionality sagemath is a mathematical software with a notebook programmable in python its library covers many aspects of mathematics including algebra combinatorics numerical mathematics number theory and calculus the python language reimplemented in java platform is used for numeric and statistical calculations with dd visualization by the dmelt project python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language including in finite element method software such as abaqus d parametric modeler like freecad d animation packages such as ds max blender cinema d lightwave houdini maya modo motionbuilder softimage the visual effects compositor nuke d imaging programs like gimp inkscape scribus and paint shop pro and musical notation program or scorewriter capella gnu debugger uses python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as c containers esri promotes python as the best choice for writing scripts in arcgis it has also been used in several video games and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in google app engine the other two being java and go python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance python can also be implemented in apis of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers python has been used in artificial intelligence tasks as a scripting language with module architecture simple syntax and rich text processing tools python is often used for natural language processing tasks many operating systems include python as a standard component the language ships with most linux distributions amigaos  freebsd netbsd openbsd and os x and can be used from the terminal many linux distributions use installers written in python ubuntu uses the ubiquity installer while red hat linux and fedora use the anaconda installer gentoo linux uses python in its package management system portage python has also seen extensive use in the information security industry including in exploit development most of the sugar software for the one laptop per child xo now developed at sugar labs is written in python the raspberry pi singleboard computer project has adopted python as its main userprogramming language libreoffice includes python and intends to replace java with python python scripting provider is a core feature since version  from  february  languages influenced by python pythons design and philosophy have influenced several programming languages including pythons development practices have also been emulated by other languages the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for and issues surrounding a change to the language in pythons case a pep is also used in tcl and erlang because of pythons influence python has been awarded a tiobe programming language of the year award twice in  and  which is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the course of a year as measured by the tiobe index
