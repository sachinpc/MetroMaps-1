openvg openvg is an api designed for hardwareaccelerated d vector graphics its primary platforms are mobile phones gaming  media consoles and consumer electronic devices it was designed to help manufacturers create more attractive user interfaces by offloading computationally intensive graphics processing from the cpu onto a gpu to save energy openvg is well suited to accelerating flash and mobile profile of svg sequences the opengl es library provides similar functionality for d graphics openvg is managed by the nonprofit technology consortium khronos group history the openvg group was formed on july   by a selection of major firms including dlabs bitboys ericsson hybrid graphics imagination technologies motorola nokia palmsource symbian and sun microsystems other firms including chip manufacturers ati lg electronics mitsubishi electric nvidia and texas instruments and software andor ip vendors dmp esmertec etri falanx microsystems futuremark hi corporation ikivo huone formerly mtis superscape and wowm have also participated in the working group the first draft specification from the group was made available at the end of  and the  version of the specification was released on august   on january   zack rusin announced the start of an independent open source implementation of openvg built on top of qtopengl shortly after ivan leben started another open source project to implement an ansi c implementation of the specification on top of opengl since february   the openvg sample reference implementation is available from the khronos website under mit open source license on december   the khronos group publicly released the openvg  specification this latest revision includes glyph rendering for accelerated text improved antialiasing and flash support an updated reference implementation is also provided as well as a conformance test suite on may   zack rusin from tungsten graphics added openvg state tracker to mesa which enables svg vector graphics to be hardware accelerated by any galliumdbased driver it was removed again in mesa  on june   on september  openvg working group decided not to make any regular meeting for further standardization however working group decided to continue maintenance and promotion of openvg  specification
