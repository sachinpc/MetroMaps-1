wine software wine recursive acronym for wine is not an emulator is a free and open source compatibility layer software application that aims to allow applications designed for microsoft windows to run on unixlike operating systems wine also provides a software library known as winelib against which developers can compile windows applications to help port them to unixlike systems it duplicates functions of windows by providing alternative implementations of the dlls that windows programs call and a process to substitute for the windows nt kernel this method of duplication differs from other methods that might also be considered emulation where windows programs run in a virtual machine wine is predominantly written using blackbox testing reverseengineering to avoid copyright issues the name wine initially was an abbreviation for windows emulator its meaning later shifted to the recursive acronym wine is not an emulator in order to differentiate the software from cpu emulators while the name sometimes appears in the forms wine and wine the project developers have agreed to standardize on the form wine the phrase wine is not an emulator is a reference to the fact that no processor code execution emulation occurs when running a windows application under wine emulation usually refers to the execution of compiled code intended for one processor such as x by interpretingrecompiling software running on a different processor such as powerpc such emulation is almost always much slower than execution of the same code by the processor for which the code was compiled in wine the windows applications compiled x code runs at near native speed on the computers x processor just as it does when running under windows windows system services are also supplied by wine in the form of wineserver in a  survey by desktoplinuxcom of  linux desktop users  of respondents reported using wine to run windows applications this plurality was larger than all x virtualization programs combined as well as larger than the  who reported not running windows applications history bob amstadt the initial project leader and eric youngdale started the wine project in  as a way to run windows applications on linux it was inspired by two sun microsystems products the wabi for the solaris operating system and the public windows initiative which was an attempt to get the windows api fully reimplemented in the public domain as an iso standard but rejected due to pressure from microsoft in  wine originally targeted bit applications for windows x but focuses on bit and bit versions which have become the standard on newer operating systems the project originated in discussions on usenet in composlinux in june  alexandre julliard has led the project since  the project has proven timeconsuming and difficult for the developers mostly because of incomplete and incorrect documentation of the windows api while microsoft extensively documents most win functions some areas such as file formats and protocols have no publicly available specification from microsoft microsoft windows also includes undocumented lowlevel functions undocumented behavior and obscure bugs that wine must duplicate precisely in order to allow some applications to work properly consequently the wine team has reverseengineered many function calls and file formats in such areas as thunking the wine project originally released wine under the same mit license as the x window system but owing to concern about proprietary versions of wine not contributing their changes back to the core project work as of march  has used the lgpl for its licensing wine officially entered beta with version  on  october  version  was released on  june  after  years of development version  was released on  july  version  on  march  and version  on  july  development versions are released roughly every two weeks corporate sponsorship the main corporate sponsor of wine is codeweavers which employs julliard and many other wine developers to work on wine and on crossover codeweavers supported version of wine crossover includes some applicationspecific tweaks not considered suitable for the winehq version as well as some additional proprietary components the involvement of corel for a time assisted the project chiefly by employing julliard and others to work on it corel had an interest in porting wordperfect office its office suite to linux especially corel linux corel later cancelled all linuxrelated projects after microsoft made major investments in corel stopping their wine effort other corporate sponsors include google which hired codeweavers to fix wine so picasa ran well enough to be ported directly to linux using the same binary as on windows google later paid for improvements to wines support for adobe photoshop cs wine is also a regular beneficiary of googles summer of code program software architecture wine implements the windows application binary interface abi entirely in user space rather than as a kernel module services normally provided by the kernel in windows are provided by a daemon known as the wineserver whose task is to implement basic windows functionality as well as integration with the x window system and translation of signals into native windows exceptions although wine implements some aspects of the windows kernel it is not possible to use native windows drivers with it due to wines underlying architecture this prevents certain applications and games from working for example those using starforce copyprotection which requires virtual device drivers to be installed wine is primarily developed for linux but the os x freebsd and solaris sparc was dropped in  ports are currently  well maintained although a packaged file for mac isnt available wine is also available for netbsd and a number of other systems via pkgsrc since october  wine also works on the arm platform when used as winelib which lets developers compile windows code on linux using wine as a library some versions of wines dlls are available for microsoft windows but wine does not fully compile or run on windows yet galliumd the galliumd driver model creates a module called galliumd state tracker a free and opensource galliumd state tracker was written for microsoft directd  in c and another one for directd  written in c which has not been maintained after some modification to wine it is now possible to use directd  games without the requirement to translate directd calls into opengl calls thus gaining a huge performance boost functionality the developers of the directd portions of wine have continued to implement new features such as pixel shaders to increase game support wine can also use native dlls directly thus increasing functionality but then a license for windows is needed unless the dlls were distributed with the application itself winecfg is a gui configuration utility included with wine winecfg makes configuring wine easier by making it unnecessary to edit the registry directly although if needed this can be done with the included registry editor similar to windows regedit wine also includes its own opensource implementations of several other windows programs such as notepad wordpad control iexplore and explorer the wine application database appdb is a communitymaintained database about which windows applications work with wine and how well they work backward compatibility wine ensures good backward compatibility with legacy windows applications including those written for windows  wine can mimic different windows versions required for some programs going as far back as windows version  however windows x and windows x support was removed from wine development version  if dosbox is installed on the system see below on msdos wine development version  and later nevertheless show the windows  option for the windows version to mimic but wine still wont run most windows  programs because msdos and windows functions are not currently integrated backward compatibility in wine is superior to that of windows as newer versions of windows can force users to upgrade legacy windows applications in many cases wine can offer better legacy support than newer versions of windows with compatibility mode wine can run bit windows programs on a bit operating system which uses an x bit cpu bit versions of microsoft windows cannot run bit windows programs wine partially supports windows console applications and the user can choose which backend to use to manage the console choices include raw streams curses and user when using the raw streams or curses backends windows applications will run in a unix terminal bit applications preliminary support for bit windows applications was added to wine  in december  this requires at least gcc version  and the wine developers expect that it will take significant time before support stabilizes however as almost all windows applications are available in bit versions and the bit version of wine can run on bit platforms this is seen as a nonissue the bit port of wine also has preliminary wow support  which allows both bit and bit windows applications to run inside the same wine instance thirdparty applications some applications require more tweaking than simply installing the application in order to work properly such as manually configuring wine to use certain windows dlls the wine project does not integrate such workarounds into the wine codebase instead preferring to focus solely on improving wines implementation of the windows abi while this approach focuses wine development on longterm compatibility it makes it difficult for users to run applications that require workarounds consequently many thirdparty applications have been created to ease the use of those applications that dont work out of the box within wine itself the wine wiki maintains a page of current and obsolete thirdparty applications windows ce wine will not run windows ce programs there is an ongoing project to port wine to arm processors which may in the future be used as a base for a winece running windows ce programs however there is a prealpha proofofconcept version of wine that can run windows ce programs called winece msdos early versions of microsoft windows run on top of msdos and windows programs may depend on msdos programs being runnable wine does not have good support for msdos but starting with development version  wine tries running msdos programs in dosbox if dosbox is available on the system however due to a bug current versions of wine incorrectly identify windows x and windows x programs as msdos programs attempting to run them in dosbox which does not work compatibility for internet explorer internet explorer can be installed directly on wine however it is not recommended to do so since there is an alternative with wine and at least in the past it crashed or does not work well on recent versions of wine which had poor support for internet explorer internet explorer  can be installed on wine  but crashes frequently internet explorer  is buggy on wine  and internet explorer  refuses to install on wine rc internet explorer  bit version does not work very well on  and the bit version does not load web pages on rc internet explorer  also crashes constantly on wine  internet explorer  both bit and bit and  cannot be installed an alternative for installing internet explorer directly is to use ieslinux however it is not compatible with the latest versions of wine and the development of ieslinux is still inactive other versions of wine the core wine development aims at a correct implementation of the windows abi as a whole and has sometimes lagged in some areas of compatibility with certain applications directd for example remained unimplemented until  although newer releases have had an increasingly complete implementation crossover codeweavers markets crossover specifically for running microsoft office and other major windows applications including some games codeweavers employs alexandre julliard to work on wine and contributes most of its code to the wine project under the lgpl codeweavers also released a new version called crossover mac for intelbased apple macintosh computers on  january  crossover now includes the functionality of both the crossover games and crossover pro lines therefore crossover games and crossover pro are no longer available as single products crossover games was optimized for running windows video games unlike crossover it didnt focus on providing the most stable version of wine instead experimental features are provided to support newer games cedega  winex transgaming technologies produced the proprietary cedega software formerly known as winex cedega represented a fork from the last mitlicensed version of wine in  much like crossover games transgamings cedega was targeted towards running windows video games on  january  transgaming technologies announced continued development of cedega technology under the gametree developer program transgaming technologies allowed members to keep using their cedega id and password until  february  cider transgaming has also produced cider a library for appleintel architecture macintoshes instead of being an enduser product cider like winelib is a wrapper allowing developers to adapt their games to run natively on intel mac os x without any changes in source code wineetersoft the russian company etersoft has been developing a proprietary version of wine since  wineetersoft supports popular russian applications for example centerprise by c company  etersoft was going to issue wineetersoft cad which is oriented towards cad systems such as autocad bricscad and compassd darwine darwine is a port of the wine libraries to darwin and to mac os x for both the powerpc and intel x architectures all patches for x version were merged back into the main branch of wine in  development on the ppc version was abandoned mike kronenberg previously created the winehelper for darwine to add a gui and os x style app for interacting with wine which was later replaced by winebottler darwine now provides os x compatible packages compiled from the wine repository wine for android on  february  at the fosdem talk in brussels alexandre julliard demonstrated an early demo of wine running on googles android operating system pipelightwinecompholio the pipelight team has produced a custom version of wine that acts as a wrapper for windows npapi plugins within linux browsers this tool permits linux users to run microsoft silverlight the windows version of adobe flash and the unity web plugin along with a variety of other npapi plugins the project provides an extensive set of patches against the upstream wine project some of which occasionally get approved and added to upstream wine other projects using wine source code other projects using wine source code include reception the wine project has received a number of technical and philosophical complaints and concerns over the years security because of wines ability to run windows binary code concerns have been raised over native windows viruses and malware affecting unixlike operating systems wine can run most malware but programs running in wine are confined to the current users privileges restricting some undesirable consequences for this reason the developers of wine recommend never running it as the superuser malware research software such as zerowine runs wine on linux in a virtual machine to keep the malware completely isolated from the host system another security concern is when the implemented specifications are illdesigned and allow for security compromise because wine implements these specs it will also implement any security vulnerabilities they contain wine vs native unix applications a common concern about wine is that its existence means that vendors are less likely to write native linux mac os x and bsd applications as an example of this it is worth considering ibms  operating system os warp an article describes the weaknesses of os which killed it the first one being the wine project itself responds to these complaints on one of its wiki pages also the wine wiki page claims that wine can help break the chickenandegg problem for linux on the desktop the use of wine for gaming has proved specifically controversial in the linux community as some feel it is preventing or at least hindering the further growth of native gaming on the platform microsoft microsoft has not made public statements about wine however the microsoft update software will block updates to microsoft applications running in wine on  february  ivan leo puoti discovered that microsoft had started checking the windows registry for the wine configuration key and would block the windows update for any component as puoti noted its also the first time microsoft acknowledges the existence of wine
