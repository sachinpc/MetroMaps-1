java ee connector architecture java ee connector architecture jca is a javabased technology solution for connecting application servers and enterprise information systems eis as part of enterprise application integration eai solutions while jdbc is specifically used to connect java ee applications to databases jca is a more generic architecture for connection to legacy systems jca was developed under the java community process as jsr  jca  jsr  jca  and jsr  jca  jca and java ee jee version  requires application servers to support jca version  jee version  requires application servers to support jca version  java ee version  requires application servers to support jca version  contracts the java ee connector architecture defines a standard for connecting a compliant application server to an eis it defines a standard set of systemlevel contracts between the java ee application server and a resource adapter the system contracts defined by version  of the java ee connector architecture are described by the specification as follows jca version  adds system contracts to the specification as follows eis integration jca adapters can be built to integrate with various enterprise information system such as siebel systems sap ag great plains systems oracle applications etc siebel provides api to integrate with various platforms like java c net visual basic etc for java it provides an interface called java data bean jdb the siebel adaptor provides data access via the jdb api great plains systems provides an interface called econnect to integrate with other platforms sap provides an interface for java called sap java connector sap jco
