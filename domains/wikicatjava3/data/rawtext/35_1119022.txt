filezilla filezilla is a free software crossplatform ftp application consisting of filezilla client and filezilla server client binaries are available for windows linux and mac os x server binaries are available for windows only the client supports ftp sftp and ftps ftp over ssltls support for sftp ssh file transfer protocol which can be used to share folders over a network is not implemented in filezilla server filezillas source code is hosted on sourceforge and the project was featured as project of the month in november  however there have been criticisms that sourceforge bundles malicious software with the application and that filezilla stores users ftp passwords insecurely history filezilla was started as a computer science class project in the second week of january  by tim kosse and two classmates before they started to write the code they discussed under which license they should release the code they decided to make filezilla an opensource project because many ftp clients were already available and they didnt think that they would sell a single copy if they made filezilla commercial features these are some features of filezilla reception in may  chris foresman assessed ftp clients for ars technica saying of filezilla some friends in the tech support world often recommend the free and opensource filezilla which offers a mac os x version in addition to windows and linux but ive never been thrilled about its busy interface which can be daunting for novice users writing for ars technica in august  emil protalinski said this weeks free thirdparty application recommendation is filezilla this ftp client is very quick and is regularly updated it may not have a beautiful gui but it certainly is fast and has never let me down go daddy clarion university of pennsylvania and national capital freenet recommend filezilla for uploading files to their web hosting services filezilla is available in the repositories of many linux distributions including debian ubuntu trisquel and parabola gnulinuxlibre in january  cnetcom gave filezilla their highest rating of spectacularfive out of five stars since the projects participation in sourceforges program to create revenue by adware several reviewers started warning about downloading filezilla and discouraged users from using it criticism bundled adware issues in  the projects hosting site sourceforgenet provided the main download of filezilla with a download wrapper offering additional software for the user to install numerous users reported that some of the adware installed without consent despite declining all install requests or used deception to obtain the users acceptance to install among the reported effects are web browser being hijacked with content start page and search engines being forcibly changed popup windows privacy or spying issues sudden shutdown and restart events possibly leading to loss of current work some of the adware was reported to resist removal or restoration of previous settings or were said to reinstall after a supposed removal also users reported adware programs to download and install more unwanted software some causing alerts by security suites for being malware the filezilla webpage offers additional download options without adware installs but the link to the adware download appears as the primary link highlighted and marked as recommended as of  filezilla displays ads called sponsored updates when starting the application these ads appear as part of the check for updates dialog missing password encryption from version  onwards filezilla stores all saved usernames and passwords as plain text files this allows any malware that has gained even limited access to the users system to simply read the data stored in these files and to remotely transfer this data to the attacker potentially handing over control of websites and servers used for further spreading malware and creating powerful botnets however the proposed master password encryption would be the only solution in certain use cases on windows  and  users would need a professional or higher license for ntfs encrypting file system or enterprise for bitlocker drive encryption in order to make your system secure enough for plaintext passwords effectively making the other windows editions insecure for using with filezilla furthermore filezilla does not communicate to the user the fact that passwords are stored in plain text storing encrypted private key files is still not supported in current versions as well as using sshagent in the same way as previous versions of filezilla private key authentication is usually recommended over passwordbased authentication release history the release notes shown are for the current series build filezilla server filezilla server is a sister product to filezilla client it is an ftp server supported by the same project and features support for ftp and ftp over ssltls filezilla server is currently available only on the windows platform filezilla server is a free open source ftp server its source code is hosted on sourceforgenet features filezilla server supports ftp and ftps ftp over ssltls other features
