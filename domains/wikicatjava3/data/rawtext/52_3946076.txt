ibatis ibatis is a persistence framework which automates the mapping between sql databases and objects in java net and ruby on rails in java the objects are pojos plain old java objects the mappings are decoupled from the application logic by packaging the sql statements in xml configuration files the result is a significant reduction in the amount of code that a developer needs to access a relational database using lower level apis like jdbc and odbc other persistence frameworks such as hibernate allow the creation of an object model in java say by the user and create and maintain the relational database automatically ibatis takes the reverse approach the developer starts with a sql database and ibatis automates the creation of the java objects both approaches have advantages and ibatis is a good choice when the developer does not have full control over the sql database schema for example an application may need to access an existing sql database used by other software or access a new database whose schema is not fully under the application developers control such as when a specialized database design team has created the schema and carefully optimized it for high performance on may   the development team forked the code creating a new project called mybatis and making new releases there as a consequence the apache ibatis project became inactive and was moved to the apache attic in june  usage for example assume there is a database table and a java class  to read the product record having the key into a new pojo the following mapping is added into an ibatis xml mapping file a new java product object can then be retrieved from the database for product number  as follows in the mapping file example codice refers to the long integer value passed into the query if the parameter is a java object then values from properties on that object can be inserted into the query using a similar codice notation for example if the parameter class is a codice which has a property called codice then codice can be replaced with codice the codice object is an instance of class codice availability the founder of ibatis has publicly stated his dismay with java  but has continued to release new versions of ibatis for java versions  and  came out in april  and  in july the framework is currently available in java net and ruby rbatis versions the jbati project is a javascript orm inspired by ibatis the apache ibator tool is closely related it connects to your database and uses its metadata to generate ibatis mapping files and java classes history in  a project called ibatis was started by clinton begin originally the focus was on the development of cryptographic software solutions the first product to be released by ibatis was secrets a personal data encryption and signing tool much like pgp secrets was written entirely in java and was released under an open source license that year microsoft published a paper to demonstrate that its recent net  framework was more productive than java for that purpose microsoft built its own version of suns web pet store a web project that sun had used to show java best practices java blueprints microsoft claimed that net was  times faster and  times more productive than java in  clinton developed an application called jpetstore to demonstrate that java could be more productive than net and could also do so while achieving a better architecture than was used in the microsoft implementation jpetstore  had a big impact and the database layer that clinton used attracted the attention of the community soon ibatis database layer  project started composed by two components ibatis dao and ibatis sql maps ibatis  was released in june  it was a complete redesign while keeping the same features clinton donated the ibatis name and code to apache software foundation and the project stayed in the asf for six years eventually ibatis dao was deprecated considering that better dao frameworks were available such as spring framework on may   ibatis  was published and simultaneously the development team decided to continue the development of the framework at google code under a new project called mybatis on june   apache announced that ibatis was retired and moved to the apaches attic
