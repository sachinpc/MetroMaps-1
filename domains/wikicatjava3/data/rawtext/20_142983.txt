ibm db ibm db contains database server products developed by ibm these products all support the relational model but in recent years some products have been extended to support objectrelational features and nonrelational structures like json and xml historically and unlike other database vendors ibm produced a platformspecific db product for each of its major operating systems however in the s ibm changed track and produced a db common server product designed with a common code base to run on different platforms current supported platforms db for linux unix and windows informally known as db luw db for zos mainframe db for i formerly os db for vm  vse history db traces its roots back to the beginning of the s when edgar f codd a researcher working for ibm described the theory of relational databases and in june  published the model for data manipulation in  the ibm san jose research center developed a relational dbms system r to implement codds concepts a key development of the system r project was sql to apply the relational model codd needed a relational database language he named dslalpha at the time ibm didnt believe in the potential of codds ideas leaving the implementation to a group of programmers not under codds supervision who violated several fundamentals of codds relational model the result was structured english query language or sequel when ibm released its first relational database product they wanted to have a commercialquality sublanguage as well so it overhauled sequel and renamed the basically new language structured query language sql to differentiate it from sequel the acronym sequel was changed to sql because sequel was a trademark of the ukbased hawker siddeley aircraft company ibm bought metaphor computer systems to utilize their gui interface and encapsulating sql platform that had already been in use since the mid s in parallel with the development of sql ibm also developed query by example qbe the first graphical query language ibms first commercial relational database product sqlds was released for the dosvse and vmcms operating systems in  in  ibm released query by example for the vm platform where the tableoriented frontend produced a linearsyntax language that drove transactions to its relational database later the qmf feature of db produced real sql and brought the same qbe look and feel to db the name db or ibm database  was first given to the database management system or dbms in  when ibm released db on its mvs mainframe platform when informix corporation acquired illustra and made their database engine an objectsql dbms by introducing their universal server both oracle and ibm followed suit by changing their database engines to be capable of objectrelational extensions in  ibm bought informix software and in the following years incorporated informix technology into the db product suite db can technically be considered to be an objectsql dbms for some years db as a fullfunction dbms was exclusively available on ibm mainframes later ibm brought db to other platforms including os unix and ms windows servers then linux including linux on z systems and pdas this process occurred through the s the inspiration for the mainframe version of dbs architecture came in part from ibm ims a hierarchical database and its dedicated database manipulation language ibm dli db is also embedded in the ios operating system for ibm system i iseries formerly the as and versions are available for zvse and zvman earlier version of the code that would become db luw linux unix windows was part of an extended edition component of os called database manager ibm extended the functionality of database manager a number of times including the addition of distributed database functionality by means of distributed relational database architecture drda that allowed shared access to a database in a remote location on a lan note that drda is based on objects and protocols defined by distributed data management architecture ddm eventually ibm took the decision to completely rewrite the software the new version of database manager was called db and db respectively other versions of db with different code bases followed the same  naming convention and became db for the as dbvse for the dosvse environment and dbvm for the vm operating system ibm lawyers stopped this handy naming convention from being used and decided that all products needed to be called product for platform for example db for os the next iteration of the mainframe and the serverbased products were named db universal database or db udb in the mids ibm released a clustered db implementation called db parallel edition which initially ran on aix this edition allowed scalability by providing a shared nothing architecture in which a single large database is partitioned across multiple db servers that communicate over a highspeed interconnect this db edition was eventually ported to all linux unix and windows luw platforms and was renamed to db extended enterprise edition eee ibm now refers to this product as the database partitioning feature dpf and sells it as an addon to their flagship db enterprise product in mid  ibm announced viper which is the codename for db  on both distributed platforms and zos db  for zos was announced in early  ibm claimed that the new db was the first relational database to store xml natively other enhancements include oltprelated improvements for distributed platforms business intelligencedata warehousingrelated improvements for zos more selftuning and selfmanaging features additional bit exploitation especially for virtual storage on zos stored procedure performance enhancements for zos and continued convergence of the sql vocabularies between zos and distributed platforms in october  ibm announced viper  which is the codename for db  on the distributed platforms there were three key themes for the release simplified management business critical reliability and agile xml development in june  ibm announced cobra the codename for db  for luw db  adds data compression for database indexes temporary tables and large objects db  also supports native xml data in hash partitioning database partitioning range partitioning table partitioning and multidimensional clustering these native xml features allows users to directly work with xml in data warehouse environments db  also adds several features that make it easier for oracle database users to work with db these include support for the most commonly used sql syntax plsql syntax scripting syntax and data types from oracle database db  also enhanced its concurrency model to exhibit behavior that is familiar to users of oracle database and microsoft sql server in october  ibm introduced its second major release of the year when it announced db purescale db purescale is a database cluster solution for nonmainframe platforms suitable for online transaction processing oltp workloads ibm based the design of db purescale on the parallel sysplex implementation of db data sharing on the mainframe db purescale provides a faulttolerant architecture and shareddisk storage a db purescale system can grow to  database servers and provides continuous availability and automatic load balancing in  it was announced that db can be an engine in mysql this allows users on the system i platform to natively access the db under the ibm i operating system formerly called os and for users on other platforms to access these files through the mysql interface on the system i and its predecessors the as and the system db is tightly integrated into the operating system and comes as part of the operating system it provides journaling triggers and other features in early  ibm announced the next version of db db  code name galileo for linux unix and windowsdb  contained a number of new data management capabilities including row and column access control which enables finegrained control of the database and multitemperature data management that moves data to cost effective storage based on howhot or cold how frequently the data is accessed the data is ibm also introduced adaptive compression capability in db  a new approach to compressing data tables in june  ibm released db  code name kepler the latest version of db on linux unix and windows on april   ibm announced db luw  with a planned release date of june  for download editions ibm offers seven editions advanced enterprise server edition advanced workgroup server edition enterprise server edition workgroup server edition express edition developer edition and expressc db expressc is free of charge version of db but limited to two cpu cores and gb of ram and without enterprise support and fixpacks db expressc has no limit on number of users or on database size db for zos the mainframe is available in its traditional product packaging or in the value unit edition which allows customers to instead pay a onetime charge db also powers ibm infosphere warehouse which offers data warehouse capabilities infosphere warehouse is available for zos it includes several bi features such as etl data mining olap acceleration and inline analytics db  for linux unix and windows contains all of the functionality and tools offered in the prior generation of db and infosphere warehouse on linux unix and windows ibm provides  cloud services for db on its bluemix platform technical information db can be administered from either the commandline or a gui the commandline interface requires more knowledge of the product but can be more easily scripted and automated the gui is a multiplatform java client that contains a variety of wizards suitable for novice users db supports both sql and xquery db has native implementation of xml data storage where xml data is stored as xml not as relational data or clob data for faster access using xquery db has apis for rexx pli cobol rpg fortran c c delphi net cli java python perl php ruby and many other programming languages db also supports integration into the eclipse and visual studio integrated development environments purequery is ibms data access platform focused on applications that access data purequery supports both java and net purequery provides access to data in databases and inmemory java objects via its tools apis and runtime environment as delivered in ibm data studio developer and ibm data studio purequery runtime error processing an important feature of db computer programs is error handling the sql communications area sqlca structure was once used exclusively within a db program to return error information to the application program after every sql statement was executed the primary but not singularly useful error diagnostic is held in the field sqlcode within the sqlca block the sql return code values are later versions of db added functionality and complexity to the execution of sql multiple errors or warnings could be returned by the execution of an sql statement it may for example have initiated a database trigger and other sql statements instead of the original sqlca error information should now be retrieved by successive executions of a get diagnostics statement see sql return codes for a more comprehensive list of common sqlcodes
