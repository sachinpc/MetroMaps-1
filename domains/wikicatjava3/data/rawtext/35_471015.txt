doxygen doxygen   is a documentation generator a tool for writing software reference documentation the documentation is written within code and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date doxygen can cross reference documentation and code so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code doxygen is free software released under the terms of the gnu general public license design like javadoc doxygen extracts documentation from source file comments in addition to the javadoc syntax doxygen supports the documentation tags used in the qt toolkit and can generate output in hypertext markup language html as well as in microsoft compiled html help chm rich text format rtf portable document format pdf latex postscript or man pages uses programming languages supported by doxygen include c c c d fortran idl java objectivec perl php python tcl and vhdl other languages can be supported with additional code it runs on most unixlike systems mac os x and windows the first version of doxygen borrowed code from an early version of doc developed by roland wunderling and malte zckler at zuse institute berlin later the doxygen code was rewritten by dimitri van heesch example code the generic syntax of documentation comments is to start a comment with an extra asterisk after the leading comment delimiter  many programmers like to mark the start of each line with spaceasteriskspace as follows but that is not necessary many programmers avoid using cstyle comments and instead use c style single line comments doxygen accepts comments with additional slash as doxygen comments the following illustrates how a c source file can be documented an alternative approach for documenting parameters is shown below it will produce the same documentation richer markup is also possible for instance add equations using latex commands
