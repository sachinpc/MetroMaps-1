mldonkey mldonkey is an open source multiprotocol peertopeer file sharing application that runs as a backend server application on many platforms it can be controlled through a user interface provided by one of many separate frontends including a web interface telnet interface and over a dozen native client programs originally a linux client for the edonkey protocol it now runs on many flavors of unixlike os x microsoft windows and morphos and supports numerous peertopeer protocols it is written in ocaml with some c and some assembly history development of the software began in late  the original developer of mldonkey is fabrice le fessant from inria it was originally conceived as an effort to spread the use of ocaml in the open source community in january  slyckcom reported brief friction between mldonkey developers and the official overnet metamachine developers which denounced mldonkey as a rogue client allegedly for incorrect behavior on the network versions before  have a known security vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the web interface to read any file on the file system features features of mldonkey core written in the ocaml programming language and licensed under the gpl the application separates the user interface which can be a web browser telnet or a thirdparty gui application and the code that interacts with the peertopeer networks mldonkey is able to connect simultaneously to different peers using different network protocols in addition it can download and merge parts of one file from different network protocols although this feature is currently documented as experimental mldonkey runs in a terminal session and does not require a gui environment saving memory and processing resources behavior is controlled by editable configuration files orin a more user friendly fashionfrom a separate user interface from release  on support for gnutella and g are no longer compiled in by default as both plugins are buggy and currently unmaintained however it is still possible to compile them in by making the appropriate setting in the configuration file references general references
