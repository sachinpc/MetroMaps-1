unified parallel c unified parallel c upc is an extension of the c programming language designed for highperformance computing on largescale parallel machines including those with a common global address space smp and numa and those with distributed memory eg clusters the programmer is presented with a single shared partitioned address space where variables may be directly read and written by any processor but each variable is physically associated with a single processor upc uses a single program multiple data spmd model of computation in which the amount of parallelism is fixed at program startup time typically with a single thread of execution per processor in order to express parallelism upc extends iso c  with the following constructs the upc language evolved from experiences with three other earlier languages that proposed parallel extensions to iso c  ac splitc and parallel c preprocessor pcp upc is not a superset of these three languages but rather an attempt to distill the best characteristics of each upc combines the programmability advantages of the shared memory programming paradigm and the control over data layout and performance of the message passing programming paradigm
