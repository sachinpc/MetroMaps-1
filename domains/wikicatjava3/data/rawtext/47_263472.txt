scipy scipy pronounced sigh pie is an open source python library used for scientific computing and technical computing scipy contains modules for optimization linear algebra integration interpolation special functions fft signal and image processing ode solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering scipy builds on the numpy array object and is part of the numpy stack which includes tools like matplotlib pandas and sympy there is an expanding set of scientific computing libraries that are being added to the numpy stack every day this numpy stack has similar users to other applications such as matlab gnu octave and scilab the numpy stack is also sometimes referred to as the scipy stack scipy is also a family of conferences for users and developers of these tools scipy in the united states euroscipy in europe and scipyin in india enthought originated the scipy conference in the united states and continues to sponsor many of the international conferences as well as host the scipy website the scipy library is currently distributed under the bsd license and its development is sponsored and supported by an open community of developers it is also supported by numfocus which is a community foundation for supporting reproducible and accessible science python scientific computing environment a typical python scientific computing environment includes many dedicated software tools for example the scipy librarypackage the scipy package of key algorithms and functions core to pythons scientific computing capabilities available subpackages include data structures the basic data structure used by scipy is a multidimensional array provided by the numpy module numpy provides some functions for linear algebra fourier transforms and random number generation but not with the generality of the equivalent functions in scipy numpy can also be used as an efficient multidimensional container of data with arbitrary datatypes this allows numpy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases older versions of scipy used numeric as an array type which is now deprecated in favor of the newer numpy array code history in the s python was extended to include an array type for numerical computing called numeric this package was eventually replaced by travis oliphant who wrote numpy in  as a blending of numeric and numarray which had been started in  as of  there was a growing number of extension modules and increasing interest in creating a complete environment for scientific and technical computing in  travis oliphant eric jones and pearu peterson merged code they had written and called the resulting package scipy the newly created package provided a standard collection of common numerical operations on top of the numeric array data structure shortly thereafter fernando prez released ipython an enhanced interactive shell widely used in the technical computing community and john hunter released the first version of matplotlib the d plotting library for technical computing since then the scipy environment has continued to grow with more packages and tools for technical computing
