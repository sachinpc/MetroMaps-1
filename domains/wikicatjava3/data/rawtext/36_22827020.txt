qt creator qt creator is a crossplatform c javascript and qml integrated development environment which is part of the sdk for the qt gui application development framework it includes a visual debugger and an integrated gui layout and forms designer the editors features include syntax highlighting and autocompletion but purposely not tabs although plugins are available qt creator uses the c compiler from the gnu compiler collection on linux and freebsd on windows it can use mingw or msvc with the default install and can also use microsoft console debugger when compiled from source code clang is also supported history development of what would eventually become qt creator had begun by  or earlier under transitional names workbench and later project greenhouse it debuted during the later part of the qt  era starting with the release of qt creator version  in march  and subsequently bundled with qt  in sdk  this was at a time when the standalone qt designer application was still the widget layout tool of choice for developers there is no indication that creator had layout capability at this stage the record is somewhat muddied on this point perhaps due to changes in ownership or the emphasis on qt quick but the integration of qt designer under qt creator is first mentioned at least as early as qt  ca late  currently in the qt  era it is simply stated that qt designers functionality is now included as part of sic qt creator ide projects qt creator includes a project manager that can use a variety of project formats such as pro cmake autotools and others a project file can contain information such as what files are included into the project custom build steps and settings for running the applications editors qt creator includes a code editor and integrates qt designer for designing and building graphical user interfaces guis from qt widgets the code editor in qt creator supports syntax highlighting for various languages in addition to that the code editor can parse code in c and qml languages and as a result code completion contextsensitive help semantic navigation are provided qt designer is a tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces guis from qt widgets it is possible to compose and customize the widgets or dialogs and test them using different styles and resolutions directly in the editor widgets and forms created with qt designer are integrated with programmed code using the qt signals and slots mechanism qt quick designer is a tool for developing animations by using a declarative programming language qml targets qt creator provides support for building and running qt applications for desktop environments windows linux freebsd and mac os mobile devices android blackberry maemo and meego and embedded linux devices build settings allow to switch between build targets different qt versions and build configurations for mobile device targets qt creator can generate an installation package install it to a mobile device that is attached to the development computer and run it there installation packages can be published on the ovi store tools qt creator is integrated with a set of tools such as version control systems and qt simulator the following version control systems are supported qt simulator is a tool for testing qt applications that are intended for mobile devices in an environment similar to that of the device debuggers qt creator does not include a debugger for native code it provides a debugger plugin that acts as an interface between the qt creator core and external native debuggers to debug the c language qt creator displays the raw information provided by the native debuggers in a simplified manner debuggers supported are
