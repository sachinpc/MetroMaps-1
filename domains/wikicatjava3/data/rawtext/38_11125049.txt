javafx javafx is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications as well as rich internet applications rias that can run across a wide variety of devices javafx is intended to replace swing as the standard gui library for java se but both will be included for the foreseeable future javafx has support for desktop computers and web browsers on microsoft windows linux and mac os x before version  of javafx developers used a statically typed declarative language called javafx script to build javafx applications because javafx script was compiled to java bytecode programmers could also use java code instead javafx applications could run on any desktop that could run java se on any browser that could run java ee or on any mobile phone that could run java me javafx  and

mobile devices javafx mobile x applications can be developed in the same language javafx script as javafx x applications for browser or desktop and using the same tools javafx sdk and the javafx production suite this concept makes it possible to share codebase and graphics assets for desktop and mobile applications through integration with java me the javafx applications have access to capabilities of the underlying handset such as the filesystem camera gps bluetooth or accelerometer an independent application platform built on java javafx mobile is capable of running on multiple mobile operating systems including android windows mobile and proprietary realtime operating systems javafx mobile was publicly available as part of the javafx  release announced by sun microsystems
